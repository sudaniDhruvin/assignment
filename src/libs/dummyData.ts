        "Immigration explodes in Australia - despite Anthony Albanese promising that it would drop before the election Immigration much higher than forecast for 2024-25 By STEPHEN JOHNSON, ECONOMICS REPORTER FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA Published: 06:57 BST, 13 June 2025 | Updated: 07:01 BST, 13 June 2025 e-mail View comments Immigration levels are continuing to soar despite Anthony Albanese promising before the last election that population growth levels would moderate. In the year to April, 440,330 migrants moved to Australia on a permanent and long-term basis, new data released on Friday showed. This net figure, covering skilled migrants and international students, is almost a third higher than the 335,000 level forecast for the 2024-25 financial year in Treasury's pre-election March Budget. Senator Andrew Bragg, the Opposition's housing and homelessness spokesman, said high immigration levels were worsening Australia's housing crisis. 'The government has done no modelling on the impact and the nexus between bringing in hundreds of thousands of people a year and building virtually no houses, relative to the overall requirement,' he told ABC Radio in Brisbane . 'Whilst we are nowhere near Labor's housing target, I think it makes a lot of sense to look at the nexus between migration and housing completions.' The 77,720 arrival figure for April alone was the highest monthly intake ever for that time of year, following the start of the new university year. Morgan Begg, the director of research at the Institute of Public Affairs think tank, said the government could no longer be trusted to accurately predict immigration levels. 'After a succession of failed migration estimates, the federal government no longer has any credibility in projecting future migration levels,' he said. Immigration levels are continuing to soar despite Anthony Albanese promising before the last election that population growth levels would moderate (pictured is Sydney's Town Hall station) 'The forecasts used in federal budgets are continuously undermined by the government’s weakness in controlling excessive migration intakes.' The Albanese Government and the states are vowing to build 1.2million homes over the five years to June 2029. That would mean 240,000 homes a year but in 2024, just 177,313 new residential properties were built, Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed. The National Housing Supply and Affordability Council is also concerned, last month predicting just 938,000 new dwellings would be built in the five years to June 2029. That's 21.8 per cent below Labor's 1.2million target. Seek senior economist Blair Chapman said high immigration was keeping a cap on wages growth, with pay levels growing by just 3.4 per cent in the year to March. 'In some sectors, it's going to help alleviate some of that labour market tightness we're seeing with skilled workers coming in,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'Often, those occupations most in demand are able to get workers from overseas on approved visas so that does keep a cap on some of the biggest salary increases.' In the year to April, 440,330 migrants moved to Australia on a permanent and long-term basis, new data released on Friday showed (pictured is Prime Minister Anthony Albanese) Read More Ben Fordham unleashes spray as Albanese fails to meet housing target because of immigration Wages growth has moderated despite unemployment remaining low at 4.1 per cent. But Mr Chapmann said high immigration would do little to address labour shortages in construction, because of strict trade licensing rules. 'There are licensing requirements that prevent people coming straight into those roles,' he said. High population growth has stopped Australia sinking into a recession but even so, the economy grew by just 1.3 per cent in the year to March - a level well below the long-term average of 3 per cent. Gross domestic product per capita shrunk by 0.2 per cent in the March quarter. Australia is in danger of sinking into a per capita recession again, that had persisted from the March quarter of 2023 to the September quarter of 2024 - marking the worst output crisis since the early 1980s. Average output for every Australian went backwards when GDP was adjusted for population growth.

        'Pope Leo XIV has made waves with some of his fashion choices, returning to much of the traditional pomp of popes past',
      content:
        "When Pope Leo XIV stepped out on the central loggia of St. Peter’s Basilica to greet the crowd for the first time after his May 8 election, liturgical fashion aficionados around the globe took note: Gone was the simple white cassock and silver cross favored by Pope Francis . Back was the red satin mozzetta shoulder cape, the burgundy stola with gold embroidery and a gold cross held by a double-stranded silken gold cord. Over Leo’s first few weeks, the excitement grew among liturgical fashion-conscious Catholics as they noticed new additions to the wardrobe, or rather a return to the old additions of the papal wardrobe: cufflinks, white pants, lace. After Francis' revolutionary papacy, Vatican watchers are now wondering if Leo's return to the past sartorial look means a return to the past on other things too, including more substantial policy issues. But for tailors at the elite handful of liturgical tailoring shops in Rome , there is hope that Leo's return to the fancier garb of popes past will mean a boon to business if Leo's traditional look has a trickle-down effect from the pope to priests and all those in between. The style is a return to form According to the Rev. John Wauck, professor of church communication at the Pontifical Holy Cross University in Rome, Leo's clothing choices are a “return to form,” and his attire similar to that worn by Pope Benedict XVI , Pope John Paul II and other popes going back to the middle ages. They show “a respect for tradition,” he said. Such respect for the papal office is important for many conservative Catholics. Many conservatives and traditionalists soured on Francis' informal style and disdain for tradition, which reached its pinnacle with his his crackdown on the old Latin Mass. The old liturgy was celebrated before the modernizing reforms of the 1960s Second Vatican Council; Francis greatly restricted access to the old liturgy, saying it had become a source of division in parishes. Leo has shown strong familiarity with Latin, and has taken to singing the Sunday noontime prayer in Latin. Some traditionalist Catholics are hoping Leo will take the pro-Latin path even further and reverse Francis to allow greater use of the traditional Latin Mass. Massimo Faggioli, professor of theology at Villanova University, where Leo went to college, said it's too early to tell if Leo will reverse Francis' reform. “It remains to be seen if Leo’s more traditional attire and liturgical style means that he will change Francis’ strong decisions limiting the so-called ‘Latin Mass,’\" he said. That said, Faggioli said U.S. conservatives seems particularly happy with Leo’s traditional attire, given Francis’ disdain for the fashion pomp of the papacy. “In this sense, Francis might have been a parenthesis or an interlude, more than a changer of the tradition in ‘papal style,’” he said in an email. Leo has made other changes, too At his inaugural Mass on May 18, 2025, Pope Leo XIV reached out his arm to sprinkle holy water and revealed a shirt with cufflinks, which Francis had largely avoided. He was also wearing an amitto, and an alb held in place by a cingulum. For the non-experts, the amitto is a lacy linen cloth that goes around the neck, the alb is the white tunic worn under the ceremonial vestment, and the cingulum is a braided rope with tassels that serves as a belt. If it weren’t for photographers’ long lenses relentlessly trained on the pope’s every gesture, Leo’s switch from Francis’s standard black pants to more traditional white papal trousers would have gone completely unnoticed. In addition to the clothing changes, Leo has returned to some other traditions of the Vatican that Francis eschewed. He has shown himself willing to accept the traditional “baciamano” or kissing of his ring. Francis disliked having his ring kissed and often pulled his hand away if someone tried to kiss it. “I think that what we see with Pope Leo is a willingness to embrace tradition, even if it risks seeming perhaps more formal than Pope Francis,” Wauck said. The idea is that “seeing that tradition as a treasure to be conserved and embraced as opposed to something that makes one feel perhaps a little bit standoffish.” It remains to be seen whether Leo will move into the papal apartment in the Apostolic Palace, which stood empty during the 12-year Francis papacy. Francis shocked the world by choosing to live in a small room at the Santa Marta residence at the Vatican, eating his meals in the common dining room. For the Rev. Castro Prudencio, this is all much ado about nothing. \"For Pope Francis it was simplicity. Always. And Pope Leo has taken up what Pope Benedict had and many others. That is what the church is like,” he said. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

        'There is as yet no word in English for the uniquely Indian disposition of feeling optimistic and pessimistic at the same time',
      content:
        'Hello readers! How are you? I hope you have not forgotten the official twin mottos of this column: Motto one: Life is short. Use it well. Motto two: Therefore do not watch Indian TV news for even one minute. Friends, last week, there was some disheartening news about a very young bureaucrat. This fellow, who had only joined the civil service a few years ago, had been apprehended by the authorities in the process of accepting a bribe. The ‘steal’ frame of the Republic and so on and so forth. The whole thing reminded me of an incident that happened a quarter of a century ago, when this writer was but a youth in college. It is a brief story. We will shortly come back to the main thrust of this column — linguistic confabulation. So one day, a distant relative of mine decided to retire from his business in the Middle East and return to his ancestral village in Kerala. Today this village is a bustling town. But back in those days, it was very much a villatic place. Little tea shop in the corner. Neighbours secretly trying to move fences and accost property. Coconuts falling on children. Cows in the barbershop. That kind of thing. So this guy came back and decided that he was going to dedicate his life to the people. And he would do this by standing as a candidate in the Panchayat elections. His platform was incorruptiblity, and he said he would join any of the local parties if they abided by his “clean” manifesto. The parties rushed to his house immediately. This guy was well-loved, and was prepared to self-finance his campaign. The perfect candidate. Eventually, he chose one party. And the campaigning began. And he and his party swept to power. At the time, I told my grandfather: “Wow, what a great man. I am very optimistic for this village.” My grandfather said: “Nope.” Immediately after the election, his party trooped back to his house for an emergency meeting. “Hello guy,” they said, “we need to talk about incorruptibility a little bit. Just a minor trifle. No big deal. But basically we would like to bring back corruption in a limited manner. For the betterment of the people.” Their point was as follows: ‘Look guy, you went to the Gulf and made money. We don’t have any money. We spent all our lives doing politics. Now finally we are in power. Unless you let us take a little bit of commission on the side, our families will suffer. We will only take a little bit. But otherwise we will be fully clean. It is a fair request.’ He said, fine. I told my grandfather: “Oh no.” My grandfather said: “Yep.” (My grandfather used a grand total of 300 words in his whole life. Around 150 of which were “Nadia Moidu”. A fine use of limited resources.) Dear readers, how many times have we experienced this very same roller-coaster of emotions? Young whippersnapper enters the arena. Threatens to shake things up. To destroy the status quo. To uplift the masses. To invigorate the discourse. And immediately, you think to yourself: “What a refreshing development! I am feeling so optimistic for this person... but also for the country as a whole. A new dawn is upon us!” But you also think: “However, what if a few hours after the new dawn, there is a vigilance raid because of refreshing development in the person’s mattress due to note bundle? Better to be a little bit careful. Just in case of absolute shenanigans.” Readers, there is as yet no word in the English language that captures this quintessentially Indian predicament. I propose, therefore, the word ‘nope-timism’. Example sentence: “The new CEO announced he would eliminate all office waste and introduce radical transparency, but Julie felt a tiny bit nope-timistic when she saw him take the coffee machine home, including two litres of milk.” I am confident that this new word will help us navigate public life with greater calm and balance. I am sure of it. Okay, fine. I am nope-timistic. The writer is head of talent at Clarisights. He lives in London and is currently working on a new novel.

      content:
        'A man of few words, always calm, respectful, and grounded—Vijay Rupani’s legacy is one of grace, service, and simplicity He began his political journey with the ABVP, moving on to become an RSS Pracharak, a Jan Sangh member, and later, one of the founding members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He was even imprisoned during the Emergency in 1976. This was the trajectory of Vijay Rupani—a journey familiar to many of us who followed Gujarat politics closely. I first encountered Rupani in late 2014 when I was newly assigned to cover Parliament. As a fellow Gujarati, I was thrilled to meet someone from my home state—more so because he hailed from Rajkot, not far from my family’s roots in Morbi, both towns nestled in the Saurashtra region. Rupani was cautious in his public speech, much like many seasoned Gujarat politicians, who often avoided media soundbites. Yet every time he saw me among a group of journalists, he greeted me with his signature warmth: “Kem cho, Ben?" A couple of years later, Gujarat politics was in turmoil again—this time over who would succeed then chief minister Anandiben Patel. Rupani confided in a few of us in Parliament that he was being called back to Gujarat. The very next day, I found myself at the BJP office in Gandhinagar. True to BJP tradition, I joked with Rupani: “I’m not even mentioning your name as a contender because the moment we do that in your party, it’s guaranteed not to happen!" At that point, all buzz pointed to Nitin Patel as the successor. Like most journalists, I went to his residence, interviewed him, and then returned to the BJP headquarters to file the story. My office insisted I return to Delhi, assuming the central observers’ meeting was just a formality. But destiny had other plans. By the time I reached the airport, news broke that Union minister Nitin Gadkari had declared Rupani as the next chief minister of Gujarat. Connecting with him again in 2017 during the assembly elections was not easy. Our interactions became somewhat heated, but even in disagreement, Rupani never lost his calm. Whether in Delhi or Gujarat, he always greeted me with genuine warmth. In 2021, I was again rushed to Gujarat amid speculation of a leadership change. When it became clear that Rupani was stepping down, he did so with grace, making way for Bhupendra Patel. That transition too had its quirks—Patel himself only found out about his appointment when someone sitting beside him at the meeting informed him. Rupani later bowed out of electoral politics before the 2022 Gujarat assembly elections. He was the first senior leader to do so, paving the way for others, including his former deputy CM Nitin Patel. Yet, Rupani remained active, campaigning wholeheartedly for the party and later being appointed as Punjab in-charge—an organisational challenge given the BJP’s limited presence there. Even in that new terrain, he handled his role with quiet efficiency and understanding. My family currently resides in Kolkata and belongs to the Jain community. His passing has sent shockwaves through Jain circles across Gujarat and Bengal. When I spoke to my mother last afternoon, she mourned his loss deeply and recalled how he had humbly attended our family guru’s event, making a significant contribution to jeev daya—the Jain principle of compassion towards all living beings. She also shared a tribute from Jain Guru Namra Muni Ji: “A beloved son of the Jain community, a true gem and lover of all living beings—Vijaybhai Rupani’s service will always be remembered." I also spoke with former Gujarat minister Saurabh Patel, who expressed his sorrow: “Words fail me. Rupani-ji’s greatest strength was his accessibility—he always listened. I remember how he led with resolve during the Covid-19 crisis, especially when oxygen shortages became critical. He took charge and helped the state navigate through one of its most challenging phases. His passing is an irreparable loss for Gujarat and Rajkot in particular." Senior journalist Sheela Bhatt, who has witnessed the rise of many Gujarat leaders, reflected: “He was an affable Saurashtrian, deeply rooted in the RSS ideology. Though a Jain Baniya by birth, caste never defined him. His unwavering commitment to the RSS brought him close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. During the BJP’s internal crisis under Shankersinh Vaghela’s revolt, Rupani emerged as a silent saviour—working beyond Rajkot to secure Saurashtra for Keshubhai Patel’s faction. He later rose to become BJP state president and was widely seen as close to the party’s top brass." Tragedy struck the Rupani family early in life when their youngest son, Pujit, died in an accident. Deeply affected, the family established a trust in his name to support the education of underprivileged children in Rajkot’s slum areas. The trust has since empowered countless bright students—carrying forward the legacy of a young life lost too soon. His wife, Anjali Rupani, was not only a pillar of strength but also a strong influence in his political journey. “Rupani will be sorely missed in Rajkot," Bhatt adds. “As CM, he drove development with real vision—roads, grain markets, digital initiatives, data systems... He was a textbook example of a grassroots karyakarta rising to the top in regional politics." Meanwhile, in London, a daughter awaiting the 10-hour flight of her father to be with them at home—a flight that will never reach—is an unthinkable loss for the family. As Gujarat mourns, the loss feels profoundly personal. A man of few words, always calm, respectful, and grounded—Vijay Rupani’s legacy is one of grace, service, and simplicity.',

        'In 2026, Stormont ministers will have about £16.3bn for day-to-day spending.',
      content:
        'Wednesday\'s UK Spending Review means Stormont ministers now know the rough size of their budget in the two years before the next assembly election . In 2026, they will have about £16.3bn for day-to-day spending, up by about 2% in cash terms compared to this year. That will initially rise by another 3% in cash terms in 2027 to £16.8bn. Finance Minister John O\'Dowd did not waste any time in managing expectations about what this means. "The reality is the executive will still remain in a financially constrained position, particularly in 2026-27," he said. "It is clear that significant challenges remain for our public services." Those challenges were obvious on the streets of Northern Ireland this week. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which the chief constable says is "critically underfunded", had to ask for outside help after just two nights of violence. Justice Minister Naomi Long is bidding for funding for a policing recovery plan , which is one of many competing priorities. Earlier in the week, the independent budget watchdog, the NI Fiscal Council, warned there were no easy answers to the chronic underfunding of NI Water . A lack of investment in wastewater infrastructure is already undermining other executive aims to increase housing supply and tackle pollution. The Spending Review confirmed that for the foreseeable future Stormont will continue to get a "needs-based" financial top-up. It was introduced when devolution returned last year and adds 24p to every £1 which comes to Northern Ireland via the standard devolution funding formula. A bid to increase the size of the top-up was not successful, though negotiations between Stormont and the Treasury continue. So with no immediate prospect of significant additional funds from London executive ministers will need to look again at how they spend what they have. A more stable Stormont means makes a strategic approach relatively easier. The intention is to use the Spending Review as an opportunity to agree a multi-year budget next year, the first time that will have happened in more than a decade. The Audit Office, a spending watchdog, has previously concluded that single-year budgets were hampering planning and innovation across NI public services. "The executive now needs to move away from single-year, crisis budgets and take more ownership of its own financial position," said Ann Watt, director of the Pivotal think tank. "A multi-year settlement provides a chance for ministers to plan for the next three years, and choose how best to prioritise spending, investment, reform and workforce planning." However she warned that a multi-year budget on its own will come nowhere near to solving the problems in NI public services. "Transformation is essential," she said. "This is the only way that services can be made sustainable and affordable for now and the future. "A focus on prevention and early intervention is key." Some relative minor transformation projects are underway , funded by the financial package which accompanied the return of devolution. There is probably only a limited window to start bolder, perhaps controversial, projects before the Stormont parties start to move into election mode in the second half of next year.',

        'Rishi Sunak’s aide was at the centre of a betting scandal that blew up before the 2024 General Election',
      content:
        'Senior Tories including a former MP who was a close aide of Rishi Sunak are due in court over allegations they cheated while gambling on the date of the 2024 General Election . Craig Williams, who was the MP for Montgomeryshire and Mr Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary, is accused of cheating at gambling in May 2024, just before his boss called the election. The MP, who went on to lose his seat, is also accused of feeding confidential information about election planning to two others so that they could cheat on bets. Rishi Sunak called a General Election on May 22 last year, setting the voting date for July 4. It was a move that surprised many commentators who had thought the Tories would wait until late autumn or winter to go to the polls. The 15 defendants are all due to appear at 10am at Westminster magistrates court on Friday, to face charges brought following a Gambling Commission investigation. Williams is accused of passing confidential information to Charlotte Lang, a 2019 Tory election candidate, and Thomas James, a director of Welsh Conservatives. They are both charged as co-defendants. Also in the dock is Russell George, a Tory member of the Welsh Parliament, who – similar to Williams - also represents Montgomeryshire. He was in the shadow cabinet in the Senedd but has been suspended by the Welsh Conservatives, and after being charged he announced he would not run for re-election. Also charged are Tony Lee, the Tories’ director of campaigning, and his wife Laura Saunders, who ran unsuccessfully as the Conservative candidate for Bristol North West in the election. Tony Lee is accused of passing confidential information to his wife, while both of them are accused of cheating at gambling. The list of defendants also includes Nick Mason, formerly the Tories’ chief data officer, Simon Chatfield, a former Conservative party marketing officer, ex-police officer Jeremy Hunt, Iain Makepeace, the Tories’ former head of creative, design and print, Nick Mason, a Tory councillor in Herefordshire, Paul Place, a trustee on a Conservative Party charity, James Ward, and Jacob Wilmer, who was formerly a special advisor in government. Completing the list of those charged are Anthony Hind, a deputy digital director for the Tories, who is accused of passing confidential information to Amy Hind, herself accused of cheating at gambling. Chatfield, 51, of Vicarage Hill in Lower Bourne, Farnham, George, 51, of Brynmor Park, Newtown, Wales, Amy Hind, 34, of Mannock Drive in Loughton, Essex, Hunt, 55, of Wilmots Lane in Horley, James, 38, from Brecon, Wales, Lang, 36, from St Martin’s Road in Brixton, Anthony Lee, 48, and Laura Saunders, 37, both from Ferry Street in Bristol, Makepeace, 47, from Burnopfield in Newcastle, Mason, 51, from Milton on Stour, Gillingham, Place, 54, from Hammersmith, London, Ward, 40, of Hainault Road, Leytonstone, Williams, 40, of Llanfair Caereinion, Wales, and Willmer, 39, from Southwater in Horsham, are all accused of cheating at gambling. Anthony Lee faces a second charge of enabling or assisting a person to cheat at gambling. Williams faces an additional two charges of enabling or assisting a person to cheat at gambling. Anthony Hind, 36, also of Mannock Drive in Loughton, is charged with a single count of enabling or assisting a person to cheat at gambling. When announcing the charges, the Gambling Commission said it had “charged 15 people with offences under the Gambling Act 2005 following an investigation into alleged cheating related to bets placed on the timing of the 2024 General Election. “The investigation, initiated in June 2024, focused on individuals suspected of using confidential information - specifically advance knowledge of the proposed election date - to gain an unfair advantage in betting markets. Such actions constitute an offence of cheating under Section 42 of the Gambling Act 2005, a criminal offence.” A Conservative Party spokesman said at the time: “The Conservative Party believes that those working in politics must act with integrity. Current members of staff who have been charged are being suspended with immediate effect. “Our Party is now under new leadership and we are cooperating fully with the Gambling Commission to ensure that their investigation can conclude swiftly and transparently.”',

        'Los Angeles is in meltdown over his immigration policies, protests are breaking out across the US and he’s fallen out with his self-proclaimed First Buddy — so where does the President go from here? Katie Strick reports',
      content:
        'This has, by all accounts, been a terrible week for President Donald Trump . Los Angeles is in meltdown after days of intense protests against federal immigration raids conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Fear and anger is spreading across the country, with demonstrations taking place in New York , Chicago, Seattle and Atlanta. There have been clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement, vandalism and looting, and as a result a curfew was issued for LA’s downtown area, and nearly 5,000 troops, including Marines and the National Guard, urgently deployed. The California governor Gavin Newsom has openly and strongly criticised Trump’s response, accusing him of “pulling a military dragnet” across LA. Newsom, who in a nationally televised address proclaimed that "democracy is under assault right before our eyes", adding that "the moment we\'ve feared, has arrived. He called on Americans to stand up to President Trump. All of this, and without his best friend Elon Musk to support him. Indeed, this past week has seen one of the White House \'s biggest bust-ups so far in either Trump presidency — and there has been some competition. Moreover, the power players in this particular bust-up mean it is having far-reaching global consequences, which are far from over. Since the beginning of their chest-beating bromance, insiders have predicted that the inevitable implosion of Trump and Musk\'s intense and unlikely friendship would play out in public — and play out, it has. Several facts were inevitable in the break-up. It was always going to be eccentric, like their characters. It was always going to be shared with the world. Does an argument even happen if it’s not played out on social media? And there was always going to be one loser. As longtime Tesla investor Ross Gerber put it to reporters last week: “It\'s the dumbest thing you could possibly do to think that you have more power than the president of the United States.” Gerber’s comments came as shares in Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company Tesla were sent into freefall in the wake of his high-profile bust-up with the President, plunging 14 per cent. Trump has warned of “serious consequences” if Musk ends up funding his rival party, threatening to boycott Tesla and Musk’s other companies like SpaceX, which directly relies on the US government for its NASA contracts. Pollsters currently suggest that 70 per cent of Republicans would currently side with Trump in the fallout, compared to 10 per cent who chose Musk. Perhaps it was also inevitable, then, that Musk would be the one to apologise, in the end. “I regret some of my posts about President Donald Trump last week. They went too far,” he posted on X in the early hours of Wednesday morning after Trump claimed he was “not even thinking about Elon” late last week. “The poor guy’s got a problem”, he told CNN at the time, adding “I wish him well”. The Tesla and SpaceX founder had been hinting at hopes for a reconciliation for days, despite previously insisting that Trump started the fallout in the first place. “You’re not wrong”, he tweeted in response to a post from Wall Street billionaire and loud Trump supporter Bill Ackman, who called for the two men to “make peace for the benefit of our great country” on X last week. “We are much stronger together than apart,” wrote Ackman, a man known for his market-moving opinions and growing influence in US politics, in a post now liked more than 98,000 times. Ackman’s decision to weigh into the feud between the POTUS and the richest man in the world is a reflection of quite how terrifying the prospect of a long-time fallout between the two men is being regarded by power players across the world — titillating as it might be to watch unfold online. In the week or so since their very public fallout began, everything from Trump’s impeachment to his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has been thrown into the jousting ring — causing chaos in Washington and forcing Silicon Valley execs to scramble around in a bid to pick sides. “An astonishing social media duel” between two narcissists, a “big beautiful breakup” between the President and his self-proclaimed First Buddy, and an implosion of “Washington’s most potent partnership” are among the phrases used to describe the extraordinary showdown between the POTUS and the man who helped him get re-elected. Even those who say they saw the whole thing coming say they’ve been shocked by the speed and intensity in which the world’s most powerful friendship has collapsed. Tens of billions of dollars now hang in the balance of the fight — just four months after Musk said publicly that he loved his president and friend "as much as a straight man can love another man." So what went wrong, exactly — and how did such a powerful alliance manage to implode so quickly? That depends which side you ask. For anyone so caught up in the eccentricity of the whole thing to remember, it all kicked off (publicly, at least) over the very thing that brought the two men together in the first place: money. Specifically, Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill”, which was passed by the House of Representatives last month, advancing most of his biggest policies and undermining much of the work that Musk had been lobbying for for months, such as the inclusion of an electric vehicle tax credit. The passing of Trump’s signature tax and spending bill also just so happened to fall in the same month that Musk’s 130-day tenure as a special government employee was coming to an end. The billionaire businessman, 53, pledged his full-throated support for the now-President, 78, following his assassination attempt less than a year ago, donating around $250 million to his 2024 election campaign. The two men quickly formed an inseparable bromance in the months after Trump’s inauguration, with Musk regularly staying over in the White House, binging on Häagen-Dazs ice-cream with the President and frequently bringing his five-year-old son, X, to the Oval Office and Mar-a-Lago. Earlier this year, Musk was brought on as a senior advisor to the POTUS and de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), quickly being dubbed Trump’s tweeter-in-chief as the two men’s political and business interests became increasingly interlinked. The role was always due to end after 130 days but Musk had reportedly suggested privately that he could stay on at the White House. The President declined, with Musk failing to achieve his goal of cutting $1 trillion from the federal budget. Musk was given a dignified send-off on May 30, according to Washington insiders who allege there were also private concerns about Musk’s alleged drug use and disagreements with staff. The billionaire turned up with a black eye, claiming his five-year-old son had punched him, and Trump awarded him with a golden key emblazed with the White House insignia as a leaving gift. “Elon’s service to America has been without comparison in modern history,” Trump said during the leaving speech, adding that he hoped to continue to be a “friend and adviser to the president.” The peace only lasted a matter of days. “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,” Musk posted on his social media platform X on June 3 — six days after saying the planned legislation had left him “disappointed”. He didn’t criticise Trump directly at the time, but within hours the feud had escalated. The two men erupted into an increasingly aggressive spat, hurling insults and trading blows in the way they’ve long traded expressions of bromance: publicly. Trump told reporters he was "disappointed" with Musk\'s behaviour and took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to say Musk had been "wearing thin" in his role at DOGE. He alleged that Musk "went CRAZY" when asked to leave the White House, and threatened to terminate Musk’s contracts with the federal government (“the best way to save money”). "I think it\'s a very bad thing, because he\'s very disrespectful. You could not disrespect the office of the president," he told an interview with NBC News over the weekend. Musk responded with a flurry of posts on his own social media platform, X, claiming that Trump would have lost the election without him, and was implicated in files of Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who died in jail awaiting sex trafficking charges. Epstein\'s lawyer denied the accusations and Musk has since deleted the post, as well as another calling for Trump’s impeachment. Just days after that golden key peace offering, the figurative locks to the White House had quickly been changed. According to insiders, a phone call that was due to take place between the two men on Friday did not happen, and Trump is considering selling the red Tesla he bought from Musk’s company in March. The fact that things turned so sour so quickly is in many ways a reflection of the two men’s characters — and the unlikeliness of the friendship in the first place. Perhaps it was always destined to self-combust, suggest commentators quick to point out that Musk and Trump had always been a relationship of mutual convenience, despite the White House long claiming the two men were simply ideologically aligned. In the end, it was those very things that brought the two men together that brought them apart: shared political views; compulsive social media habits; and big egos. Their breakup had the air of two squabbling exes broadcasting their breakup on reality TV. “A couple of billionaires having a hissy little catfight” is how US author Stephen King described the feud last week. The repercussions from this particular catfight, however, are rather more seismic than most. More than $150 billion has reportedly been wiped off the market value of Tesla, which could have devastating effects not only on the electric vehicle company but also on the federal agencies that have come to depend on it and any of Musk’s companies. Musk has threatened (but since reversed) a decision to begin decommissioning the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft that Nasa relies on for transport missions — a reminder of the dangers of putting public goods in the hands of private companies controlled by erratic billionaires. He has also suggested he may start a third political party to represent the “80 percent in the middle”, while Trump has warned him against defecting to the Democrats if he doesn’t want to face “serious consequences”. Betting agencies are now putting money on what will happen next. Polymarket traders say there’s a 57 per cent chance the two men will have met up by December 31, but Trump is currently claiming he doesn’t want to fix the feud. In interviews over the weekend he insisted he was not thinking about Musk, simply referring to him as “the man who has lost his mind”. Ackman isn’t the only high-profile figure calling for a reconciliation. “I learned a long time ago when I was fighting to stay out of other people’s fights,” Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, a Trump ally and former wrestler, posted on social media following the feud. “WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER!! CEASE FIRE FOR GOD’S SAKE!” tweeted US Representative Beth Van Duyne. Rapper Kanye West, who endorsed Trump for President in 2024, simply tweeted, “Broooos please noooooo. We love you both so much”, while Texas Senator Ted Cruz told his podcast listeners he felt like one of the kids of a bitter divorce, “where you’re just saying, ‘I really wish Mommy and Daddy would stop screaming”. Others find themselves quite literally caught in the middle of the Musk-Trump-bros-to-foes-feud. Katie Miller, a key figure in Trump’s first and second administrations, is among those was dubbed Musk’s “sherpa” inside DOGE and left the White House with him last month to work for him full-time, despite her husband Stephen staying on as Trump’s deputy chief-of-staff. The Washington power couple used to socialise with Musk outside of work, and now find themselves on opposite sides of the ongoing fallout. Meanwhile venture capitalist David Sacks, who Trump named as his so-called “crypto czar” in December, has a close relationship with Musk, having worked with him at PayPal in the past. Neither have commented publicly on the feud, but are likely to have their loyalties tested in the weeks and months to come. Many — particularly current and former Washington aides, Silicon Valley execs and Maga influencers — have been quick to take sides, however. Trump’s Vice-President JD Vance said this week that Musk had "gone so nuclear" he may never be welcomed back into Trump’s inner circle — a sentiment echoed by Steve Bannon, the influential Trump adviser who has long been critical of Musk. “Only the fanboys are going to stick with him,” he said of Musk following the fallout. “He’s a man without a country.” The Trump-Musk rift might appear a deeply personal one, but there are fears it signals something more fundamental for the Maga coalition. What will it mean for the president and the party’s wider future? Much of that answer lies with the Democrats, who have so far remained relatively quiet, standing back and watching the jousting match unfold — a suggestion they are currently unwilling to welcome Musk, a former Democrat donor, back into the party just yet. Will the enemy of their enemy be embraced as a friend? "It\'s a zero-sum game. Anything that [Musk] does that moves more toward Democrats hurts Republicans,” Democrat strategist Liam Kerr told reporters. Tesla staff and investors have been sent into panic mode. There had been hopes his step away from politics would mean Musk would away from his phone and step up his involvement at his tech firms. Now, his row with Trump and Trump’s threats to boycott the EV company mean they are not so sure. According to polling firm YouGov, 70 per cent of Republicans would currently side with Trump in the fallout, compared to 10 per cent who chose Musk, with several Trump allies quoting recent allegations in the New York Times about Musk’s use of drugs, particularly ketamine. According to the report, White House officials say Trump was worried about Musk’s drug use, and it was one reason the relationship eventually came to a dramatic end (other alleged reasons include Musk reportedly alienating White House staff, and getting into a physical altercation with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen). Trump has since told reporters he does not wish to comment on Musk’s drug use, and Musk himself has denied that he is taking any drugs. So what comes next, exactly? By most accounts, it is Musk has more to lose, from his future within the Maga movement to his multi-billion dollar government contracts. He may not win the battle between himself and the President, but could certainly make Trump pay a political and personal price — a fact Trump appears to be aware of, given his decision to avoid commenting on the feud during a White House event this week. The future of their relationship, according to most commentators, again depends entirely on the very thing that brought them together and broke them up: money. It was, and always has been, a transactional relationship, and despite the fireworks, the two men still share one key belief: showering tax cuts on Americans who already have more than they could ever need. Perhaps democracy is the real loser of this fight, say commentators. Whether you choose to see the Trump-Musk breakup as entertainment or a cause for concern, one thing is for certain: there are likely to be many more chapters to this strange big-ego jousting battle. As Musk warned on X last week: "Trump has 3.5 years left as president. But I will be around for 40-plus years."',

        'Los Angeles is in meltdown over his immigration policies, protests are breaking out across the US and he’s fallen out with his self-proclaimed First Buddy — so where does the President go from here? Katie Strick reports',
      content:
        'This has, by all accounts, been a terrible week for President Donald Trump . Los Angeles is in meltdown after days of intense protests against federal immigration raids conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Fear and anger is spreading across the country, with demonstrations taking place in New York , Chicago, Seattle and Atlanta. There have been clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement, vandalism and looting, and as a result a curfew was issued for LA’s downtown area, and nearly 5,000 troops, including Marines and the National Guard, urgently deployed. The California governor Gavin Newsom has openly and strongly criticised Trump’s response, accusing him of “pulling a military dragnet” across LA. Newsom, who in a nationally televised address proclaimed that "democracy is under assault right before our eyes", adding that "the moment we\'ve feared, has arrived. He called on Americans to stand up to President Trump. All of this, and without his best friend Elon Musk to support him. Indeed, this past week has seen one of the White House \'s biggest bust-ups so far in either Trump presidency — and there has been some competition. Moreover, the power players in this particular bust-up mean it is having far-reaching global consequences, which are far from over. Since the beginning of their chest-beating bromance, insiders have predicted that the inevitable implosion of Trump and Musk\'s intense and unlikely friendship would play out in public — and play out, it has. What happened between Elon Musk and Donald Trump? Several facts were inevitable in the break-up. It was always going to be eccentric, like their characters. It was always going to be shared with the world. Does an argument even happen if it’s not played out on social media? And there was always going to be one loser. As longtime Tesla investor Ross Gerber put it to reporters last week: “It\'s the dumbest thing you could possibly do to think that you have more power than the president of the United States.” Gerber’s comments came as shares in Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company Tesla were sent into freefall in the wake of his high-profile bust-up with the President, plunging 14 per cent. Trump has warned of “serious consequences” if Musk ends up funding his rival party, threatening to boycott Tesla and Musk’s other companies like SpaceX, which directly relies on the US government for its NASA contracts. Pollsters currently suggest that 70 per cent of Republicans would currently side with Trump in the fallout, compared to 10 per cent who chose Musk. Perhaps it was also inevitable, then, that Musk would be the one to apologise, in the end. “I regret some of my posts about President Donald Trump last week. They went too far,” he posted on X in the early hours of Wednesday morning after Trump claimed he was “not even thinking about Elon” late last week. “The poor guy’s got a problem”, he told CNN at the time, adding “I wish him well”. The Tesla and SpaceX founder had been hinting at hopes for a reconciliation for days, despite previously insisting that Trump started the fallout in the first place. “You’re not wrong”, he tweeted in response to a post from Wall Street billionaire and loud Trump supporter Bill Ackman, who called for the two men to “make peace for the benefit of our great country” on X last week. “We are much stronger together than apart,” wrote Ackman, a man known for his market-moving opinions and growing influence in US politics, in a post now liked more than 98,000 times. Ackman’s decision to weigh into the feud between the POTUS and the richest man in the world is a reflection of quite how terrifying the prospect of a long-time fallout between the two men is being regarded by power players across the world — titillating as it might be to watch unfold online. In the week or so since their very public fallout began, everything from Trump’s impeachment to his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has been thrown into the jousting ring — causing chaos in Washington and forcing Silicon Valley execs to scramble around in a bid to pick sides. “An astonishing social media duel” between two narcissists, a “big beautiful breakup” between the President and his self-proclaimed First Buddy, and an implosion of “Washington’s most potent partnership” are among the phrases used to describe the extraordinary showdown between the POTUS and the man who helped him get re-elected. Even those who say they saw the whole thing coming say they’ve been shocked by the speed and intensity in which the world’s most powerful friendship has collapsed. Tens of billions of dollars now hang in the balance of the fight — just four months after Musk said publicly that he loved his president and friend "as much as a straight man can love another man." So what went wrong, exactly — and how did such a powerful alliance manage to implode so quickly? That depends which side you ask. For anyone so caught up in the eccentricity of the whole thing to remember, it all kicked off (publicly, at least) over the very thing that brought the two men together in the first place: money. Specifically, Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill”, which was passed by the House of Representatives last month, advancing most of his biggest policies and undermining much of the work that Musk had been lobbying for for months, such as the inclusion of an electric vehicle tax credit. The passing of Trump’s signature tax and spending bill also just so happened to fall in the same month that Musk’s 130-day tenure as a special government employee was coming to an end. The billionaire businessman, 53, pledged his full-throated support for the now-President, 78, following his assassination attempt less than a year ago, donating around $250 million to his 2024 election campaign. The two men quickly formed an inseparable bromance in the months after Trump’s inauguration, with Musk regularly staying over in the White House, binging on Häagen-Dazs ice-cream with the President and frequently bringing his five-year-old son, X, to the Oval Office and Mar-a-Lago. Earlier this year, Musk was brought on as a senior advisor to the POTUS and de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), quickly being dubbed Trump’s tweeter-in-chief as the two men’s political and business interests became increasingly interlinked. The role was always due to end after 130 days but Musk had reportedly suggested privately that he could stay on at the White House. The President declined, with Musk failing to achieve his goal of cutting $1 trillion from the federal budget. Musk was given a dignified send-off on May 30, according to Washington insiders who allege there were also private concerns about Musk’s alleged drug use and disagreements with staff. The billionaire turned up with a black eye, claiming his five-year-old son had punched him, and Trump awarded him with a golden key emblazed with the White House insignia as a leaving gift. “Elon’s service to America has been without comparison in modern history,” Trump said during the leaving speech, adding that he hoped to continue to be a “friend and adviser to the president.” The peace only lasted a matter of days. “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,” Musk posted on his social media platform X on June 3 — six days after saying the planned legislation had left him “disappointed”. He didn’t criticise Trump directly at the time, but within hours the feud had escalated. The two men erupted into an increasingly aggressive spat, hurling insults and trading blows in the way they’ve long traded expressions of bromance: publicly. Trump told reporters he was "disappointed" with Musk\'s behaviour and took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to say Musk had been "wearing thin" in his role at DOGE. He alleged that Musk "went CRAZY" when asked to leave the White House, and threatened to terminate Musk’s contracts with the federal government (“the best way to save money”). "I think it\'s a very bad thing, because he\'s very disrespectful. You could not disrespect the office of the president," he told an interview with NBC News over the weekend. Musk responded with a flurry of posts on his own social media platform, X, claiming that Trump would have lost the election without him, and was implicated in files of Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who died in jail awaiting sex trafficking charges. Epstein\'s lawyer denied the accusations and Musk has since deleted the post, as well as another calling for Trump’s impeachment. Just days after that golden key peace offering, the figurative locks to the White House had quickly been changed. According to insiders, a phone call that was due to take place between the two men on Friday did not happen, and Trump is considering selling the red Tesla he bought from Musk’s company in March. The fact that things turned so sour so quickly is in many ways a reflection of the two men’s characters — and the unlikeliness of the friendship in the first place. Perhaps it was always destined to self-combust, suggest commentators quick to point out that Musk and Trump had always been a relationship of mutual convenience, despite the White House long claiming the two men were simply ideologically aligned. In the end, it was those very things that brought the two men together that brought them apart: shared political views; compulsive social media habits; and big egos. Their breakup had the air of two squabbling exes broadcasting their breakup on reality TV. “A couple of billionaires having a hissy little catfight” is how US author Stephen King described the feud last week.

        'Husam Zomlot calls on Labour to fulfil manifesto commitment before UN conference on two-state solution',
      content:
        'Making recognition of a Palestinian state subject to ever more conditions will only reinforce a “deadly status quo” and will be seen as siding with an apartheid regime, the Palestinian ambassador to the UK has said. Writing in the Guardian, Husam Zomlot made an impassioned plea to the Labour government to fulfil a manifesto commitment by recognising Palestine in the run-up to a high-level UN conference on the two-state solution in New York next week. Zomlot wrote: “Recognition is neither a reward for one party nor a punishment for another. It is a long-overdue affirmation of the Palestinian people’s unconditional right to exist and live freely in our homeland.” Discussions behind the scenes between western powers are going down to the wire before the conference starting on 17 June, while the US is warning that the conference is counterproductive and should be boycotted. At issue is whether a group of countries that have not yet recognised Palestine do so around the conference or instead say recognition is being offered but on a credible timeline and subject to conditions. France and the UK are conferring intensely. With the tide of Labour backbenchers behind him, Zumlot argued recognition was not purely symbolic, but an irreversible first step. He added: “Neither should recognition be subject to ever more conditions on the Palestinian side. Delaying recognition simply reinforces the deadly status quo, denying Palestinians’ equal rights until Israel consents, thus granting our occupier a permanent veto over the future.” Urging the UK to show moral clarity and leadership, he added: “Peace is not made between occupier and occupied. It can only exist between equals.” France, the co-sponsor of the conference, this week published a letter from the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, in which he stated support for Hamas “laying down its weapons” and “no longer ruling Gaza” as part of a future Palestinian state. The PA in the four-page letter also gave unprecedented commitments to reform and to holding long-delayed internationally overseen presidential elections within a year. Related: The two-state solution is a delusion | Rabea Eghbariah The French presidency said Abbas had promised that “Hamas will no longer rule Gaza and must hand over its weapons and military capabilities to the Palestinian security forces, which will oversee their removal outside the occupied Palestinian territory, with Arab and international support”. Hamas would also have to forswear violence and accept a two-state solution. In the letter, the PA also condemned the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023, supported a stabilisation mission including Arab and international forces to assist PA security forces and demanded the release of all hostages. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, described the letter as one of hope. A senior Gulf diplomat said Hamas had agreed it would not seek to continue to rule Gaza, but no agreement exists on the group’s disarmament, including the body to which it would disarm and whether its depleted leadership would be required to go into exile. He added the definition of a Hamas member was difficult. Hugh Lovatt from the European Council on Foreign Relations said: “Recognition would certainly allow London and Paris to press the PA towards political renewal, including the holding of long-overdue elections, but it does not provide them with much leverage over Hamas which does not consider recognition by itself as being of sufficient value of itself to disarm before a peace agreement with Israel is reached.” One Gulf diplomat said: “Israel is seeking the total annihilation of Hamas and will not be willing to hand security in Gaza to the PA or a multinational force.” In the UK, the Middle East minister, Hamish Falconer, came under unprecedented pressure from MPs of all parties in the Commons on Tuesday to recognise Palestine without conditions in advance of the UN conference. He indicated that the UK was involved in intense international diplomacy to find an agreed position among those states that had yet to recognise Palestine. He said he would make a Commons statement next week. Falconer in private conversations appeared sympathetic to recognition now, MPs said, but the decision rests with the prime minister, Keir Starmer. The three countries inside the G7 group of western countries most likely to recognise Palestine are France, Canada and the UK. The G7’s annual summit starts on Sunday in Canada. The conference in New York is not formally about recognition, but the steps necessary to achieve a two-state solution, something Israel used to support, but no longer does. Recognition of a Palestinian state is one way of keeping the pathway alive, it is argued. Diplomats said the diverse constellation of countries preparing the conference agenda was significant, with Qatar, Mexico and Brazil, for instance, chairing a working party on peace narratives that will try to address the levels of hate generated by the conflict on both sides. Some diplomats argue that Europe’s fear of a backlash from Donald Trump’s US over recognition is diminishing since the two sides are drifting so far apart on Israel that the hope of one influencing the other no longer acts as a glue. The new US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee , has said he does not think a two-state solution, one of the objectives of recognition, is itself any longer desirable.',

Um 2:45 Uhr heute Nacht klingelt mein Playbook-Handy. Ein Notfall, für den mich unsere australische Frühschicht wecken darf.Denn wir haben eine Mega-Krisenlage: Israel hat über Nacht den Iran und dessen Atomprogramm angegriffen. Damit droht der Region ein noch viel größerer, verheerenderer Krieg. Und unser Außenminister ist gerade mittendrin.Außerdem im Playbook: Ein SPD-Landesverband holt zum Gegenschlag gegen das Friedensmanifest aus, eine Personal-Kontroverse plagt das Bundeswehr-Beschaffungsamt, die Regierung überlegt zur Zukunft der Rente — und wir erklären, was Möwen mit dem Verschwinden der Bundesflagge in TV-Interviews zu tun haben.Sonderpodcast: Zum morgigen Geburtstag des US-Präsidenten schaut sich Gordon Repinski das Wirken von Donald Trump im Playbook Podcast an.**(Anzeige) Eine Nachricht von der Initiative Neue Soziale Marktwirtschaft: Schweres Ampel-Trauma, Wachstumsschwäche, der Standort kollidiert mit dem Weltmarkt, die Wirtschaft leidet, die Unternehmen bluten. Der Patient Deutschland braucht Hilfe. Was wir jetzt tun müssen? Bürokratie abklemmen. Industrie reanimieren. Steuerhochdruck senken. Wachstumshemmer neutralisieren. Digitale Lösungen infundieren. Kurz: Erste Hilfe für die Wirtschaft. Mehr auf INSM.de/erstehilfe.**SEITE EINSLUFTANGRIFF AUF DEN IRAN: Israels Verteidigungsminister Israel Katz spricht von einem „Präventivschlag“. Kurz nach 2 Uhr nachts sind Explosionen im Iran zu hören; Videos aus Teheran zeigen Rauchwolken über der Stadt.Laut ersten Berichten wurden militärische Ziele wie Stützpunkte und Luftverteidigung getroffen, aber es brennen auch einzelne Wohnhäuser — offenbar ein versuchter Enthauptungsschlag gegen die iranische militärische Führung. Der Chef der Islamischen Revolutionsgarden, Hossein Salami, wurde nach Angaben des iranischen Staatsfernsehens getötet.Der Hauptangriff galt jedoch Teherans Atomprogramm: Premierminister Benjamin Netanjahu sagte in einer Ansprache am frühen Morgen, man habe die „Hauptanreicherungsanlage des Irans in Natanz“ sowie dessen ballistische Raketenkapazitäten und hochrangige iranische Atomwissenschaftler attackiert.Es gehe um die Abwehr einer existenziellen Bedrohung. Der Kampf werde „so viele Tage wie nötig“ andauern. Zuvor hatten israelische Beamte gewarnt, dass der Iran aktiv an der Herstellung von spaltbarem Material für Kernwaffen arbeite und kurz vor dem Erlangen einer Atombombe sei.Point of no return: „Wir können nicht auf eine andere Zeit warten, um zu handeln, wir haben keine Wahl“, sagte der Stabschef der israelischen Armee, Eyal Zamir. Noch liegen keine verlässlichen Informationen vor, wie effektiv der Angriff war.Jahrelang hatte Israel auf gezielte Sabotage und Anschläge gesetzt, um Irans Nuklearprogramm auszubremsen — etwa mit dem Stuxnet-Computervirus, um die Zentrifugen in Urananreicherungsanlagen zu stören, oder mit Bombenanschlägen auf iranische Atomforscher. Jetzt ist man zum offenen Angriff übergegangen.USA: „Wir sind nicht involviert“ — das teilte Marco Rubio in einem Statement mit. Noch Stunden zuvor hatte Trump Netanjahu gewarnt, nicht anzugreifen — es drohe ein „massiver Konflikt“ in der Region.Der US-Präsident hatte auf einen Deal mit Teheran gehofft, um dessen Atomprogramm zu beenden. Man stehe „kurz vor einer ziemlich guten Einigung“; für Sonntag waren weitere Gespräche im Oman geplant. Wahr ist aber auch, dass der Iran erst gestern den Bau einer weiteren Urananreicherungsanlage ankündigte.In dieser hochbrisanten Lage reist Johann Wadephul in die Region: Heute ist ein Antrittsbesuch in Ägypten geplant (Pressekonferenz mit Außenminister Badr Abdelatty um 13 Uhr), danach war eine Weiterreise in den Libanon geplant, wo er heute Abend Ministerpräsident Nawaf Salam und Außenminister Jussef Radschi treffen soll. Morgen sollte es eigentlich nach Jordanien und auch nach Israel gehen. Dort wollte Wadephul sich insbesondere für eine Verbesserung der schlechten humanitären Lage in Gaza einsetzen und auf eine friedliche Lösung in diesem Konflikt einwirken — doch ob diese Reiseplanung jetzt noch steht, ist fraglich.Israel befürchtet iranischen Gegenschlag „in unmittelbarer Zukunft“: Verteidigungsminister Katz verhängte den Ausnahmezustand, alle zivilen Flüge am Ben Gurion Airport wurden gestrichen.„Ein Vergeltungsschlag ist definitiv“, hieß es am frühen Morgen auch von iranischer Seite. Teheran könnte einen massiven Raketen- und Drohnenangriff starten — noch viel heftiger als die Attacken letztes Jahr, welche noch zum größten Teil durch die Luftabwehr von Israel und Verbündeten abgefangen werden konnten.KANZLERMAPPEKRISENSITZUNGEN: Günter Sautter kann Friedrich Merz gleich heute früh zu der Eskalation im Nahen Osten briefen. Diese — und die Sorge vor einem noch viel größeren Krieg in der Region, den es jetzt zu verhindern gilt — werden Kanzleramt, Außenministerium und andere Häuser heute und die nächsten Tage schwer beschäftigen. Der Außenkanzler ist mehr gefordert denn je: Am Sonntag geht es zudem nach Kanada zum G7-Gipfeltreffen. Top-Themen sind Putins Angriffskrieg und neue Sanktionen gegen Russland (macht Donald Trump mit?), doch die jüngsten Ereignisse dürften alles überschatten.AnzeigePARTEIENKONFRONTATIONSKURS: Seit der Veröffentlichung des Manifests zur Friedenssicherung stellt sich eigentlich nur noch die Frage, wie groß das Thema auf dem SPD-Bundesparteitag Ende Juni wird. Die SPD Hannover gibt nun eine Antwort: Es soll zur Konfrontation mit dem Russland-Kurs von Ralf Stegner und Co. kommen.Aus dem Zentrum Niedersachsens soll ein Initiativantrag eingebracht werden, der die Unterzeichner des ursprünglichen Manifests in die Schranken weisen soll, hört Jasper Bennink aus Hannover. Die Personen hinter dem Aufschlag sind Adis Ahmetovic und Boris Pistorius, die in den beiden Stadt-Wahlkreisen zur Bundestagswahl angetreten sind. Ahmetovic ist dazu Vorsitzender der SPD Hannover; Pistorius hat gerade erst gestern in Kyjiw weitere 1,9 Milliarden Ukraine-Hilfe angekündigt.Rückenwind für den eingeschlagenen Kurs: Gehofft wird auf eine starke Unterstützung des Gegenentwurfs, auch um die aktuelle Russlandlinie der Partei weiterzuführen, die auch Lars Klingbeil gestern noch einmal betonte.Angedacht ist eine Weiterführung des Beschlusses vom Parteitag 2023. Ein positiver Ausgang soll Klingbeils Position bei der Wiederwahl als Parteivorsitzenden stärken.Schon wieder Taurus: In Kyjiw erteilte Pistorius der Lieferung der lang geforderten Taurus-Marschflugkörper eine klare Absage. „Sie haben gefragt, ob wir es in Erwägung ziehen“, sagte er gestern. „Die Antwort ist nein.“ UKRAINE-UNTERSTÜTZUNG, NEUE WEHRPFLICHT — auch ein Blick ins 334 Seiten lange reguläre Antragsbuch zum Bundesparteitag lohnt sich. Hier geht’s lang. FREUNDSCHAFTSANFRAGE: Sahra Wagenknecht macht der SPD Avancen — zumindest dem Teil, der hinter dem Manifest steht. Die BSW-Chefin ruft zur gemeinsamen Front gegen den „brandgefährlichen Kriegskurs von Merz und Klingbeil“ auf. Auch die Linkspartei zeigt Kooperationsbereitschaft.BENDLERBLOCKBAHN FREI FÜR DIE WEHRPFLICHT? Ein neues Zwei-Stufen-Modell zum Wehrdienst setzt zunächst auf Freiwilligkeit, hält sich aber die Wiedereinführung der Wehrpflicht vor, falls die Lücke aus 60.000 fehlenden Soldaten nicht geschlossen werden kann, berichtet das Handelsblatt. Pistorius will den Entwurf im Sommer vorlegen.MACHTKAMPF STATT ZEITENWENDE: Eigentlich soll sich das Beschaffungsamt der Bundeswehr in Koblenz darum kümmern, dass die Bundeswehr besser und schneller ausgerüstet wird. Doch aktuell beschäftigt sich die mehr als 10.000 Mitarbeiter große Mammutbehörde mal wieder mehr mit sich selbst, berichtet mein Kollege Lars Petersen. So hatte im vorigen Jahr überraschend General Michael Bender kommissarisch die Spitze des Leitungsstabs der Behörde übernommen — was intern für Unmut sorgte.Der Grund: Bender war zuvor nach Vorwürfen an seinem Führungsstil vom Kommando der Gebirgsjägerbrigade 23 vorzeitig entbunden worden. Im Januar 2025 wurde er sogar zu mehreren Tausend Euro Geldstrafe verurteilt, weil er seine Befehlsbefugnis missbraucht habe. Trotzdem der neue (kommissarische) Führungsjob.Vor wenigen Monaten übernahm schließlich ein erfahrener Beamter aus dem Beschaffungsamt den Leitungsstab, Bender wurde Sonderbeauftragter von Amtschefin Annette Lehnigk-Emden. Doch völlig überraschend trat der Beamte im Mai wieder ab und ließ sich freiwillig (!) zurück auf seinen alten Job versetzen — inklusive des Gehalts-Downgrades von B6 (ca. 11.300 Euro) auf B3 (9.600 Euro). Offiziell will sich das Beschaffungsamt nicht „zu internen Vorgängen“ äußern.Im Informationsschreiben an die Mitarbeiter des Amtes, das Lars vorliegt, wird der Beamte in höchsten Tönen gelobt und der ungewöhnliche Schritt als großartige Fehlerkultur verkauft. Tatsächlich, so berichten mehrere Mitarbeiter, kam es monatelang zu einem Machtkampf zwischen dem Beamten und Bender. Der General habe sich immer wieder in die Arbeit des Beamten eingemischt, Amtschefin Lehnigk-Emden ließ es offenbar laufen. Irgendwann habe der Beamte die Nase voll gehabt, heißt es. Auch dazu will man sich nicht äußern. Bender hat übrigens inzwischen wieder den Leitungsstab übernommen, heißt es im Mitarbeiterbrief. Ohne Dankesworte der Leitung.BAND DES BUNDESBUNDESFLAGGE WEG: Wenn der Kanzler oder andere Spitzenpolitiker dem ZDF ein Interview geben, ist normalerweise ein Live-Bild mit Brandenburger Tor und schwarz-rot-goldener Bundesflagge eingeblendet. Hier ein Beispiel noch aus Scholz-Zeiten. Doch seit einiger Zeit ist sie nicht mehr da, die Fahne. Besonders aufmerksamen Fernsehzuschauern ist das natürlich aufgefallen. Uns natürlich nicht. Aber wir haben einen Tipp dazu bekommen. Rasmus Buchsteiner ist der Sache nachgegangen.Erste Erkenntnis: Der nunmehr verwaiste Mast — Fotobeweis hier — steht auf dem Dach des Otto-Wels-Hauses, einem Bundestagsgebäude Unter den Linden. Auskunft: „Seit dem Frühjahr 2025 wird die Bundesflagge in der Zeit von etwa Mitte Mai bis Ende Juli nicht mehr auf dem Otto-Wels-Haus gehisst“, ist aus der Parlamentsverwaltung zu hören. Grund: Vogelschutz.Full Disclosure: Seit 2010 brüten besonders geschützte Großmöwen auf dem Dach. Connaisseure wissen, dass in Berlin vor allem Silbermöwen und Steppenmöwen vorkommen. No Schwarz-Rot-Gold: Der Bundestag erklärt den Fahnenverzicht so: „Der notwendige Aufenthalt von Personen für das Hissen der Flagge auf dem Dach wird für die Jungvögel sowie für die adulten Tiere als Bedrohung empfunden und kann dazu führen, dass die Jungvögel flüchtend vom Dach springen.”REICHES RENTEN-RECHNUNG: Die Wirtschaftsministerin denkt laut nach über unsere Alterssicherung. „Das Renteneintrittsalter wird ja langsam erhöht“, so Katherina Reiche am Donnerstag. „Die Frage ist: Ist das schnell genug, ambitioniert genug? Ich würde sagen: nein.“ Große Wirkung: Die Wortmeldung kommt zu einem besonderen Zeitpunkt. Wie Rasmus berichtet, arbeitet die Bundesregierung gerade mit Hochdruck an ihrem Rentenpaket. Lars Klingbeil und Bärbel Bas machen Druck, dass es noch vor dem SPD-Parteitag Ende Juni präsentiert werden kann. Zahlreiche offene Fragen gibt es noch bei der Mütterrente III. Die CSU drängt auf 2026 als Starttermin, was sich aber als kaum praktikabel erweist. Später starten oder erst rückwirkend zahlen? Um solche Fragen geht es gerade. Rentenniveau: Zunächst bis 2031 soll per Gesetz garantiert werden, dass die Renten genauso stark steigen wie die Löhne. Um das Niveau danach zu halten, würde es sehr, sehr teuer. Bis zu 18 Milliarden Euro pro Jahr könnten es sein. Frühstart-Rente: Union und SPD wollen, dass der Staat für jedes Kind zwischen sechs und 18 Jahren monatlich zehn Euro bereitstellt, damit das Geld in private Altersvorsorge investiert werden kann. Nur: Was Kriterien und Anlageform angeht, gibt es noch viel zu klären, hört Rasmus.SEIN PRIVATES GELD hat er zu großen Teilen bei „seiner“ Bank in der Lüneburger Heide, ließ Klingbeil jüngst wissen. Als Finanzminister ist er nun für den Finanzplatz Deutschland zuständig, bekam es bereits mit der Übernahmeschlacht um die Commerzbank zu tun. Finanz-Speed-Dating: Heute tourt er durch Frankfurt. Um 13 Uhr ist er bei Bundesbank-Chef Joachim Nagel, eine Stunde später bei Bafin-Präsident Mark Branson, um 15 Uhr besucht er KfW-Chef Stefan Wintels. Und dann — 16 Uhr — geht Klingbeil an die Börse. mit CEO Stephan Leithner.LÄNDERPUNKTENOCH KEIN OK: Michael Kretschmer verlangt Nachverhandlungen beim Investitionspaket. „Die Steuerausfälle von Ländern und Kommunen müssen ausgeglichen werden“, fordert er im Gespräch mit Jürgen Klöckner und Tom Schmidtgen von unserem Pro-Newsletter Industrie & Handel.Optimistisch: Zwei Drittel der Steuerausfälle durch die Sonder-Abschreibungen würde nicht der Bund tragen, sagte Kretschmer. Über die konkreten Maßnahmen werde noch verhandelt. „Ich bin sehr optimistisch, dass wir eine Einigung bis zum 11. Juli erzielen und keinen Vermittlungsausschuss brauchen.“ Am 11. Juli sollen die Länder zustimmen.Beschluss ist keine Formsache: Heute berät der Bundesrat erstmals über das Investitionspaket der Bundesregierung. Die Länder haben Nachverhandlungen verlangt, weil sie die Steuerausfälle nicht tragen wollen. Kommt es zu keiner Einigung, verzögert sich auch Merz’ Wirtschaftswende weiter.EUROVISIONLO SIENTO: Nachdem sein Vertrauter Santos Cerdán wegen Korruptionsvorwürfen zurücktreten musste, hat sich Ministerpräsident Pedro Sánchez bei den Spaniern entschuldigt. Neuwahlen lehnt er ab. Cerdán bestreitet die Vorwürfe, muss aber am 25. Juni vor Gericht aussagen. Es gibt Beweise für Bestechung und illegale Auftragsvergaben. Sánchez kündigte eine externe Prüfung seiner Partei an. Der Skandal gefährdet die fragile Regierung.TRANSATLANTIKRICHTERSPRUCH IN LOS ANGELES: Der Einsatz der Nationalgarde in Los Angeles war verfassungswidrig und US-Präsident Donald Trump muss das Kommando bis Freitagmittag wieder an Gouverneur Gavin Newsom übergeben. Das verfügte ein Bundesrichter am Donnerstagabend.Die US-Regierung legte umgehend Berufung ein. Schließlich hat der Präsident noch größere Pläne: Wie Tom Homan, Trumps Koordinator in der Einwanderungspolitik, gegenüber der Washington Post erklärte, will die US-Regierung die Nationalgarde noch stärker in ihre Abschiebemaßnahmen einbinden.Festnahmen sollen die Gardisten nicht vornehmen, „aber sie können durchaus bei Sicherheit, Transport, Infrastruktur und Aufklärung unterstützen“, sagte Homan.Sollte die Berufung scheitern, müsste Trump vor den Obersten Gerichtshof ziehen. Allein auf den scheint er zu hören, wie bereits am Nachmittag Verteidigungsminister Pete Hegseth im Rahmen einer Anhörung im Repräsentantenhauses durchblicken ließ.Bis zu einem Urteil wird Trump seine Abschiebepolitik unbeirrt weiterverfolgen. Mehr dazu und wie die USA auf Israels Angriff auf den Iran reagiert haben, lesen Sie heute Morgen bei meinen Kollegen in unserem US-Newsletter DC Decoded.SOCIAL BREAKDIE NETZTRENDS DER WOCHE präsentiert Ihnen wieder Social-Media-Experte Finn Werner.RAP-STAR wäre womöglich die passendere Karriere für Linksaußen-MdB Ferat Koçak: Mit ernster Miene und Palischal liefert der Neuköllner auf TikTok eine Lipsync-Performance zum politisch... sagen wir: fragwürdigen Track „Rot“ von Dahabflex.

        'Have Democrats at last found a credible champion in the California governor – and can he exploit his LA stand-off with the president to become a 2028 White House contender, asks Mary Dejevsky',
      content:
        'S ixty years is a very, very long time in fast-moving US politics. But that is how long ago it is since a US president ordered the national guard into a state without a request from the state governor. The line between federal and state-level law enforcement is one of the many very clear demarcations of authority in the US federal system. It is another hallowed line that Donald Trump has crossed . From a purely public order standpoint, Trump’s dispatch to Los Angeles of a 4,000-strong contingent from the national guard, bolstered by 700 US marines, appears to be having the intended effect. The violent protests that erupted in response to the efforts of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to detain and deport people with no legal right to be in the United States have died down. Order has mostly been restored, and thousands are under arrest – whether for immigration violations, for violence, or for defying the city-imposed curfew. Smaller protests that subsequently broke out in other cities also appear to have been discouraged by Trump’s characteristically unsubtle – and constitutionally contestable – application of presidential power. If the short-term effect looks close to being an unqualified success from the perspective of the White House and Trump’s political base, there has to be a question, indeed several questions, about the longer term. How likely is it that the president’s actions are storing up liabilities, either for him or his political heirs? One immediate effect has undoubtedly been to propel California’s governor, Gavin Newsom , into the limelight again as a leader of the state-level opposition to Trump, as he became in Trump’s first term. And it has to be said that the Democrats are in sore need of such leadership. Far from being energised by Kamala Harris’s defeat, to refresh their party and rally around a new leader, Democrats have seemed at a complete loss as to how to combat the second-term Trump. Could the Democrats now find a new champion in Gavin Newsom – and is he equal to the task? Might he even be able to exploit his stand-off with Trump to become a plausible presidential contender for 2028? He certainly seems up for the challenge. Having said after Trump’s victory – to the distress of some supporters – that he would work with the second-term president, Newsom has come out fighting over the ICE raids on illegal migrants and has threatened to sue through the courts over the deployment of the national guard. And whereas the last time the national guard was sent into a state without the governor’s say-so – to protect civil rights protesters in Alabama – there was an element of covert politicking, there is nothing of that this time around. An argument can – and doubtless will – be made that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility; that the ICE agents met violent resistance and that they required protection that the city of Los Angeles and the state of California either would not (or could not) give. Whether that justifies federal intervention, however, is a matter that may well be decided in court. So long as the national guard operate within their lawful parameters, which appears to be the case – and so long as the marines are not used to keep civil order, but only to protect the national guard – there may be no case for Trump to answer. What’s more, however much Trump’s opponents might like to present him as riding roughshod over states’ rights to assert federal control, this is not entirely true either. The Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v Wade on abortion rights , which was lauded by Trump, was as much of a reassertion of states’ rights as a rolling back of the rights of women. A win on the issue of states’ rights would undoubtedly project Newsom on to the national stage. Even then there could still be a question about his prospects of rising to lead a coherent Democratic Party opposition to Trump more broadly. Yes, he was a contender to become Kamala Harris’s running mate – had an all-California ticket not been judged a potential liability (which, of course, it was). Yes, he became a thorn in the side of the first-term Trump on a host of issues. And yes, Ronald Reagan made the governorship of California a stepping stone to the presidency. But that might not be enough. Newsom has provoked vocal opposition within his own majority Democrat state, and there is little doubt that Trump would be up for a fierce rhetorical and political fight in defence of his programme. He has shown little but contempt for Newsom hitherto, whom he sees as left, liberal and weak, with an insatiable appetite for high taxes. He is to the great detriment, as he sees it, of California’s wellbeing (a one-person equivalent, in a way, of Trump’s other object of hatred, the EU). Many of Trump’s loyal base will be of like mind. Then again, even if Newsom were to emerge as a politician capable of arguing the Democrat cause on the national stage, there are compelling reasons why this particular stand-off might not work in his favour in the bigger scheme of things. The problem for Newsom is that, even as Trump has been losing support nationally on other issues, support remains strong for his tough stance on migration. Appearing to support illegal aliens to remain in the US is probably not a hill Democrats will want to die on, either now, in the run-up to next year’s midterm congressional elections, or in 2028. Trump may also be less vulnerable than many previous presidents to party political opposition. There is some new talk of impeachment (already), but he saw off two attempts before, and anyway, electorally, as a second-term president, he has little to lose, for all the loose talk he might try to change the constitution to make possible a third term. The awkward reality is that Republicans running for office are more dependent on him, than he is on them. Added to which, Trump is not a party creature. He is a one-off deal-maker turned president, who is testing constitutional power to its limits. His Republican badge is a flag of convenience, required by the political system. Traditional Republicans may be counting the days until their party can nominate a real, more predictable, Republican for the highest office. In the meantime, their political fortunes are tied to his, and his sights are set on what he will bequeath, which includes a country with fewer illegal migrants, where America – in his definition – comes first. Gavin Newsom may have a national future; but he might do well to rein in his fury and bide his time.',

Sarah Wheaton here, welcoming you to this Friday edition of Brussels Playbook — sorry to say that the weekend is definitely not starting early, news-wise.Nick Vinocur will be with you for Monday’s Brussels Playbook. DRIVING THE DAY: ISRAEL STRIKES IRAN WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: Israel launched what it described as “preemptive” military strikes aimed at Iran’s nuclear facilities, which also killed the country’s top three generals. The attack struck “at the heart of Iran’s nuclear weaponization program,” including its main enrichment facility in Natanz, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised address. He added that Operation Rising Lion “will continue for as many days as it takes.”Scale of the damage: Aside from Iranian nuclear facilities, Israel targeted the country’s air defenses, missile facilities, weapons depots, labs, Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps officials and scientists, per the New York Times. Iranian state TV reported Hossein Salami, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, was among the dead.**A message from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance supported by the Gates Foundation: Since 2000, Gavi has protected over 1 billion children from vaccine-preventable diseases. Alongside the EU, Gavi 6.0 will strengthen global health security and keep Europe safe by protecting more children against more diseases, faster than ever before.**IRAN VOWS “LETHAL” RETRIBUTION: Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on X that Israel had “prepared a bitter fate for itself.” The Iranian military, also on X, said of its plans for retaliation: “This will not be a mere demonstration of will or technological capability. This time, our response will be lethal.” Netanyahu told Israelis to prepare to remain in bomb shelters for an extended period of time. SEEKING DISTANCE: U.S. officials rushed to declare Washington had played no role in the operation, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying in a statement that “Israel took unilateral action against Iran.” He warned: “Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.”Notably missing from Rubio’s statement: The typical U.S. lines wholeheartedly defending Israel’s right to take action and reminding the world of America’s “ironclad” commitment to the country, as POLITICO’s Eric Bazail-Eimil and Nahal Toosi point out.HOW WILL TRUMP RESPOND? The American president had earlier urged Israel to hold off on striking Iran. Instead, Washington wanted to keep pursuing talks with Tehran aimed at curbing its nuclear program, the next round of which is set to be held Sunday in Oman, Eric and Nahal write.Trump will attend a National Security Council meeting at 5 p.m. Brussels time today.TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONS G7 CONFRONTS PRICE CAPS, EXISTENCE: A relatively new roster of G7 leaders will gather in the Canadian Rockies starting Sunday amid questions about the formation’s future as a strategic planning platform in the Trump era, Koen Verhelst reports.Newbies: German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will be making their inaugural appearances at the G7 summit, which starts with informal meetings Sunday and continues through Tuesday.Low expectations: “The best-case scenario in my mind,” said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Geoeconomics Center at the Atlantic Council, “is that there’s no real blowups.” What already seems clear is that there will be no joint communiqué, with leaders instead convening around seven separate documents on specific topics. It shows the tension Donald Trump has cast over the meeting by slapping tariffs on his allies.Top target: An EU-backed deal to lower the oil price cap on Russian fossil exports to $45 from $60 — but Trump is worried about the potential impact on energy prices. Morning Trade has a more extensive preview of the gathering in Kananaskis.COSTA’S PITCH TO TRUMP: Europe has the will to step up its role in NATO and common defense, writes European Council President António Costa in an FT op-ed. But “trade conflicts and tariffs” would “undermine the very economic strength that is needed for this strategic transition.”BRUSSELS’ PITCH TO PARIS: The European Commission is weighing a side declaration to ease French concerns and secure the approval of a long-delayed trade pact with the Mercosur trade bloc, Camille Gijs, Hans von der Burchard and Antonia Zimmermann report.WARSAW CHINWAG: American and EU lawmakers will meet in Warsaw on Saturday and Sunday to talk trade, energy security, defense and AI, according to a program seen by Max Griera.Making the trip from Brussels: Brando Benifei (S&D), Bernd Lange (S&D), Paulo do Nascimento Cabral (EPP), Željana Zovko (EPP), Isabel Wiseler-Lima (EPP), Mika Aaltola (EPP), Lucia Annunziata (S&D), António Tânger Corrêa (Patriots), Dominik Tarczyński (ECR), Adam Bielan (ECR) and Nikolas Farantouris (The Left). From Capitol Hill: Five Republicans representatives and three Democrats, according to a draft list seen by POLITICO. On the Republican side: Nathaniel Moran, Joe Wilson, Victoria Spartz, Chuck Edwards and Craig Goldman. The Democrats: Jim Costa, Adam Gray and Tim Kennedy.PARTY POLITICS GREENS GRIEF CIRCLE: Over 40 leaders from European Green parties are meeting in Brussels today, licking their wounds and plotting a comeback. It’s been a rough year, starting with electoral losses in the 2024 European Parliament election, followed by their loss of influence in key strongholds like Germany and Austria.From green wave to (cutting) red tape: Green policy is not as sexy as it was in 2019; simplification is the new buzzword in Brussels (more on those efforts here and also here this morning). That’s one of the issues the leaders will address, Max Griera reports, as they start shifting their narrative from regulation to “green investment.” War over war: Leaders will also need to find a common position on Europe’s military build-up. Southern members oppose it, while the Nordics and Germans are all for it. METSOLA WATCH: Malta Today, citing sources from Malta’s National Party, reports that European Parliament President Roberta Metsola is now floating a plan under which MP Adrian Delia would become leader of the party, while she’d take the symbolic post of chair. (Metsola dodged Playbook’s efforts to corner her at a reception Thursday, see below.)KREMLIN INFLUENCE WATCH: Fernand Kartheiser, the rogue Luxembourg MEP who recently traveled to Moscow, emailed his 719 colleagues on Thursday to tell them he’d found “the Russian parliamentarians open to dialogue and willing to engage” on topics ranging from human rights to security, war and migration. “I propose to now organise such a remote meeting for interested MEPs,” he said. H/t Max Griera.SCHENGEN’S MIDLIFE CRISIS HAPPY BIRTHDAY: Forty years ago, near the small Luxembourgish commune of Schengen, ministers from Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, France and the Netherlands vowed to usher in an era of seamless European travel. Since then, the Schengen zone has become the largest area of free movement in the world, covering 450 million Europeans in 29 countries.The stat being highlighted: 2 million people commute daily across internal Schengen borders, facilitating intra-EU trade amounting to over € 4,100 billion last year (h/t the European Council press release).The stat being swept under the rug: But as POLITICO’s Hanne Cokelaere reports, the uncomfortable truth is Schengen is facing a mid-life crisis. Eleven of the Schengen Area’s 29 countries, including Austria, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, have notified the European Commission of plans to reintroduce border controls. It all started with Covid, when EU countries shuttered their borders to keep the virus out. With the border taboo broken, countries implemented measures to keep out migrants. Germany, citing “serious threats to public security” caused by illegal migration, imposed checks on all its borders last year. Slovenia, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, France and Bulgaria did likewise.The expectation: The Council of the European Union on Thursday approved a declaration to “renew its commitment to the Schengen area,” vowing that “the EU is committed to continuing to invest in a common area without internal borders, ensuring strong external border management and a high degree of internal security.” The reality: But with centrist governments across Europe attempting to respond to surging anti-immigration sentiment and support for the far right, they’re more likely to put up (proverbial) walls than to tear them down.NOW READ THIS: Germany’s tough-on-migration turn leaves Afghans in perilous limbo, reports Nette Nöstlinger.ISRAEL-GAZA ECHOS HASSAN RETURNS TO FRANCE: Franco-Palestinian MEP Rima Hassan returned to Paris on Thursday after being deported by Israeli authorities. She was detained for taking part, along with Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, in an effort to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza by sea. The left-wing parliamentarian said she was placed in solitary confinement after writing “Free Palestine” on a wall in the detention center, prompting her to begin a short hunger strike, Victor Goury-Laffont reports from Paris.Growing prominence: Hassan, born in a Palestinian refugee camp before moving to France as a teen, has become one of the most recognizable figures in France’s pro-Palestinian movement. Several thousand people gathered at Place de la République — the French capital’s go-to spot for protests — to welcome her home, highlighting her growing profile as the humanitarian situation in Gaza takes on increasing importance in French and European politics.RABBI CONFERENCE CANCELED IN SARAJEVO: A European Commission spokesperson said it was “regrettable” that the Conference of European Rabbis (CER) had to nix a gathering planned for next week in Bosnia and Herzegovina after the hotel it was meant to be held in canceled its reservation.Background: CER, an organization of Orthodox Jewish religious leaders from around Europe, was planning to hold its biannual meeting starting June 16 at the Swissotel Sarajevo. On Wednesday, the group complained in a press release that the hotel — Swissotel — had abruptly canceled it. The CER blamed the move on a Facebook post from Bosnian Labor Minister Adnan Delić labeling the meeting “an attempt to send a message of legitimization of one genocidal creation and their shameful acts of crimes against humanity.” He called for “all the relevant institutions to prevent the realization of this gathering.”Swissotel, in a statement, did not address questions about whether government messages played any role. “After careful consideration and assessment of potential safety risks related to hosting the event, the hotel decided to cancel the booking due to security reasons. This is in no way representative of any political affiliation or ideology,” the statement said. (The Bosnian labor ministry did not reply to Playbook’s email.)Accession angle: Characterizing the blocked religious gathering as a violation of fundamental rights, Pinchas Goldschmidt, CER’s president, called for Bosnia and Herzegovina’s EU accession process to be curtailed.Commission statement: Asked about the incident at Thursday’s midday briefing, European Commission spokesperson Markus Lammert invoked those fundamental rights of religion and association, calling it “regrettable that the relevant authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina have withdrawn their invitation.” The EU “remains committed” to the country’s “EU accession perspective,” he continued, and will keep monitoring the situation.**The GLOBSEC Forum takes place this week —and this year marks a special milestone: it’s their 20th anniversary. From June 12–14, leaders are gathering in Prague under the theme “Commanding (in) Chaos: Can Europe Step Up?”.**IN OTHER NEWS SÁNCHEZ APOLOGIZES FOR PARTY’S CORRUPTION: Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Thursday apologized “to the citizens and supporters of the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party,” after the Socialist Party’s third-highest ranking member, Santos Cerdán, was implicated in a kickback scandal.Sorry? Yes. Responsible? No. Sánchez, the EU’s most powerful socialist politician, rejected calls from opposition parties to resign or call a snap election, saying he felt an obligation to defend his party. The PM announced he would restructure the top of the Socialist Party and order an independent audit of its finances.

With support from the EU, we can reach the next billion even faster. The Global Summit on 25 June will launch Gavi 6.0, a renewed effort to strengthen global health security and save lives. By protecting more children against more diseases, faster than ever, Gavi is ensuring Europe’s safety by reducing cross-border threats, while supporting countries to become self-sufficient and less reliant on aid. Immunisation is one of the best buys in development, and the EU’s steadfast partnership with Gavi since 2003 has been essential to this success.

        'Presented by Equinor By SASCHA O’SULLIVAN Send ideas here | View in your browser PRESENTED BY In the midst of spending reviews, rows of migration and fights about water bosses’ bonuses, everyone could do with a laugh. So this week on Westminster Insider, host Sascha O’Sullivan speaks to a coterie of comedians and satirists in SW1 to find out: what’s the point of political satire? Legendary co-creator of Yes, Minister Jonathan Lynn explains how a show designed to make people have a laugh at the expense of some pompous civil servants defined how we now see “the blob”. Sketch-writers Madeline Grant and John Crace give us a peek into their lives of following every twist and turn of parliament. And former Tory MP Michael Fabricant explains what it’s like to be the subject of these sharp penned journalists. Sascha also speaks to Rosie Holt, who shot to comedic fame for mimicking cabinet ministers on the broadcast round in the pandemic. And Andrew Hunter Murray, author, BBC podcaster and Private Eye writer, explains when satire is it’s most dangerous for politicians – and powerful for comedians. And Lib Dem leader Ed Davey explains why he tried to use humour and comedy to make people pay attention. **A message from Equinor: It’s our ambition to be a leading company in the energy transition. We don’t have all the answers yet, but our innovations, technology, and the determination of our people will help get us there. That’s why we will always keep searching for better.

        'COMMENT: Have Democrats at last found a credible champion in the California governor – and can he exploit his LA stand-off with the president to become a 2028 White House contender, asks Mary Dejevsky',
      content:
        'Sixty years is a very, very long time in fast-moving US politics. But that is how long ago it is since a US president ordered the national guard into a state without a request from the state governor. The line between federal and state-level law enforcement is one of the many very clear demarcations of authority in the US federal system. It is another hallowed line that Donald Trump has crossed . From a purely public order standpoint, Trump’s dispatch to Los Angeles of a 4,000-strong contingent from the national guard, bolstered by 700 US marines, appears to be having the intended effect. The violent protests that erupted in response to the efforts of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to detain and deport people with no legal right to be in the United States have died down. Order has mostly been restored, and thousands are under arrest – whether for immigration violations, for violence, or for defying the city-imposed curfew. Smaller protests that subsequently broke out in other cities also appear to have been discouraged by Trump’s characteristically unsubtle – and constitutionally contestable – application of presidential power. If the short-term effect looks close to being an unqualified success from the perspective of the White House and Trump’s political base, there has to be a question, indeed several questions, about the longer term. How likely is it that the president’s actions are storing up liabilities, either for him or his political heirs? One immediate effect has undoubtedly been to propel California’s governor, Gavin Newsom , into the limelight again as a leader of the state-level opposition to Trump, as he became in Trump’s first term. And it has to be said that the Democrats are in sore need of such leadership. Far from being energised by Kamala Harris’s defeat, to refresh their party and rally around a new leader, Democrats have seemed at a complete loss as to how to combat the second-term Trump. Could the Democrats now find a new champion in Gavin Newsom – and is he equal to the task? Might he even be able to exploit his stand-off with Trump to become a plausible presidential contender for 2028? He certainly seems up for the challenge. Having said after Trump’s victory – to the distress of some supporters – that he would work with the second-term president, Newsom has come out fighting over the ICE raids on illegal migrants and has threatened to sue through the courts over the deployment of the national guard. And whereas the last time the national guard was sent into a state without the governor’s say-so – to protect civil rights protesters in Alabama – there was an element of covert politicking, there is nothing of that this time around. An argument can – and doubtless will – be made that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility; that the ICE agents met violent resistance and that they required protection that the city of Los Angeles and the state of California either would not (or could not) give. Whether that justifies federal intervention, however, is a matter that may well be decided in court. So long as the national guard operate within their lawful parameters, which appears to be the case – and so long as the marines are not used to keep civil order, but only to protect the national guard – there may be no case for Trump to answer. What’s more, however much Trump’s opponents might like to present him as riding roughshod over states’ rights to assert federal control, this is not entirely true either. The Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v Wade on abortion rights , which was lauded by Trump, was as much of a reassertion of states’ rights as a rolling back of the rights of women. A win on the issue of states’ rights would undoubtedly project Newsom on to the national stage. Even then there could still be a question about his prospects of rising to lead a coherent Democratic Party opposition to Trump more broadly. Yes, he was a contender to become Kamala Harris’s running mate – had an all-California ticket not been judged a potential liability (which, of course, it was). Yes, he became a thorn in the side of the first-term Trump on a host of issues. And yes, Ronald Reagan made the governorship of California a stepping stone to the presidency. But that might not be enough. Newsom has provoked vocal opposition within his own majority Democrat state, and there is little doubt that Trump would be up for a fierce rhetorical and political fight in defence of his programme. He has shown little but contempt for Newsom hitherto, whom he sees as left, liberal and weak, with an insatiable appetite for high taxes. He is to the great detriment, as he sees it, of California’s wellbeing (a one-person equivalent, in a way, of Trump’s other object of hatred, the EU). Many of Trump’s loyal base will be of like mind. Then again, even if Newsom were to emerge as a politician capable of arguing the Democrat cause on the national stage, there are compelling reasons why this particular stand-off might not work in his favour in the bigger scheme of things. The problem for Newsom is that, even as Trump has been losing support nationally on other issues, support remains strong for his tough stance on migration. Appearing to support illegal aliens to remain in the US is probably not a hill Democrats will want to die on, either now, in the run-up to next year’s midterm congressional elections, or in 2028. Trump may also be less vulnerable than many previous presidents to party political opposition. There is some new talk of impeachment (already), but he saw off two attempts before, and anyway, electorally, as a second-term president, he has little to lose, for all the loose talk he might try to change the constitution to make possible a third term. The awkward reality is that Republicans running for office are more dependent on him, than he is on them. Added to which, Trump is not a party creature. He is a one-off deal-maker turned president, who is testing constitutional power to its limits. His Republican badge is a flag of convenience, required by the political system. Traditional Republicans may be counting the days until their party can nominate a real, more predictable, Republican for the highest office. In the meantime, their political fortunes are tied to his, and his sights are set on what he will bequeath, which includes a country with fewer illegal migrants, where America – in his definition – comes first. Gavin Newsom may have a national future; but he might do well to rein in his fury and bide his time.',

I said, ‘please when you see him, tell him I am very sorry, I am wiser now’.“The system is a problem. Now, why did I mention President Jonathan? It takes a lot particularly in Africa to lose an election and leave, he did that.”While expressing his support for the elevation of electoral reforms, including the electronic transmission of election results, Bello El-Rufai added that if there is any truth to the rumour of an electoral amendment that would allow people to vote without a voter’s card, he would vote against such a proposal.The post ‘I Told My Father To Help Me Apologize To Him, I Am Wise Now’ – Bello El-Rufai Regrets Criticizing Jonathan appeared first on Naija News.',

      content:
        '“ Barbara Walters: Tell Me Everything ” is a documentary a lot like its subject. It’s sharp and inquiring in a playful way. It asks friendly questions but knows just when to toss in a tough one. It sizes up important people with clear-eyed worldly perception, but it’s also enthralled by the seductions of fame and money and power. “Tell Me Everything” delivers the Barbara Walters story, in all its tasty fascination and significance (for the first 15 years of her television career, she was smashing glass ceilings with every new role she took), and it captures a great deal about Walters as a person because it refuses to be intimidated by how elusive she could be. On TV, she presented herself as a fighting mensch, someone who could disarm you with that sympathetic twinkle in her eye. Yet off camera she could be ruthless. She burned through romantic relationships as if they were seasonal shopping sprees, and one of her closest friends was the dreaded Roy Cohn. She was complicated. And so was the place she occupied in journalism. For a while, the film is telling two stories at once: the chronicle of Walters’ rise in TV news, and the larger meaning it exerted because she was a woman. In 1961, when she joined NBC’s “Today Show,” she was brought on to cover “women’s stories” (we see her in one clip in a Playboy bunny outfit). While that in itself was historic, it was up to her to bust out of the leftover-1950s mentality. In 1971, her big break came, ironically, when the new host of the “Today Show,” Frank McGee, insisted to the network that he be allowed to ask the first three questions of any guest. This outraged Walters, so she began to pursue the idea of doing interviews outside the studio. What no one, even Walters, could have guessed is that she would be creating her own journalistic art form. As an interviewer, she was personal, relatable, honest, accessible, and penetrating. In her decorous way, she was revolutionary, because she went to places on a human level that the sternly responsible male TV interviewers, even the good ones, were trained not to. So though she was fighting a dozen sexist preconceptions, her gender sensibility actually gave her a huge advantage. She helped goose the ratings. And then something fluky happened. In 1974, Frank McGee succumbed to cancer at 52. It was in Walters’ contract that if McGee ever left the show, she would become co-host. She became the “Today Show’s” first female co-host on April 22, 1974. But the male antipathy she ran into was extraordinary. McGee had tried to box her out, and when she was hired away by ABC to be America’s first female network news anchor, co-hosting the “ABC Evening News” with a headline salary of $1 million a year, her co-host, Harry Reasoner, treated her with chilly contempt. During tapings of the show, she was shunned by Reasoner and the crew. She called taking the job a “mistake.” But then Roone Arledge, who had turned ABC Sports into a one-network entertainment complex, was given the opportunity to do the same thing with the news division. Arledge rescued Walters. Her one-hour interview specials were about to become news of their own. “Tell Her Everything” opens with a montage in which we see Walters pose one of her inimitable essential awkward interview questions to a variety of subjects: to Richard Nixon (“Are you sorry you didn’t burn the tapes?”), to Barbra Streisand (“Why didn’t you have your nose fixed?”), to Vladimir Putin (“Did you ever order anyone killed?”), to Fidel Castro (“Will you ever shave off that beard?” — a genius question since it’s really about what a bullshit artist he is), and to Courtney Love (“Ever do drugs in front of your child?” Love’s reply: “My God , what a question!”). “Sitting down with Barbara Walters,” says Cynthia McFadden, “no one ever got out totally unscathed.” Andy Cohen describes how as an interview subject, you would be surrounded by flowers and delicate lighting, only to have Barbara hit you with that hardball question — which, in a way, was the question everyone had gathered around the TV to see. Oprah Winfrey, Connie Chung, and Bette Midler offer telling recollections of the subtle ways that Walters wielded her power. She produced great television, and you could argue that there was a moral dimension to it — that using highly strategic “Gotcha!” questions to reveal the human side of political and artistic figures colored in an essential dimension of our celebrity power culture. After watching Barbara Walters interview someone, whether they co-operated or pushed back or cried, you walked away with a more profound sense of who that person was. (Just seeing Castro laugh was an education.) So what could be wrong with that? Walters received a lot of criticism, along the lines that she was trivializing the news, and “Tell Me Everything” tends to regard that criticism as one more behind-the-curve example of a sexist journalistic culture. But there’s a larger picture that the documentary never quite confronts. Something was happening that was bigger than Barbara Walters, though she (unwittingly) helped pave the way for it. And that was the metaphysical American transformation of news into entertainment. In 1977, Walters arrived in the Middle East for the summit meeting of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and Israeli prime minster Menachem Begin, and the documentary shows us how unhappy Walter Cronkite and John Chancellor were that she was there. Begin flirts with her in a one-on-one interview, and then we see Sadat, in a joint interview, rejecting the idea that Arab leaders would ever give up an inch of “occupied” territory — and Walters’ answer to that is not to challenge him, but to act like it’s all going to be fine. In the documentary, Katie Couric looks back at that moment and says, “Walter Cronkite later interviewed the two of them, but honestly if you’re not first, you’re not anything.” But is that really the case? Only if you’ve become part of the Peace Process as Entertainment. “Tell Me Everything” gets into the corporate back alleys of Walters’ career, which heated up after Diane Sawyer was brought into ABC to co-host “Primetime.” The show was a direct challenge to Walters on “20/20,” and she reacted to her new rival by becoming obsessed with her. Walters thought of Sawyer as a “blonde goddess” and as the “perfect woman,” and her insecurities were massive. Their parallel careers became a contest of “gets.” Who could nail the hottest interview first? Walters won more than she lost, and the apotheosis of her journalism-as-ratings-competition mentality was her exclusive interview with Monica Lewinsky, which became the highest rated TV news interview of all time (70 million people watched). Walters threw a party in her Fifth Avenue apartment the night it aired. But this just sealed the way that our public life was becoming a circus of scandalous diversion. The movie devotes its final 15 minutes to “The View,” a show that Walters largely created and that was, in its way, as pioneering as anything she’d ever done. The show brought the intimacy of women’s voices directly into America’s living rooms. It was gossipy, and irresistible, and revelatory. It extended Walters’ career (probably by 10 years), but more than that it was the fulfillment of her journalistic credo: to reveal how the personal and the political were hopelessly, eternally entwined. (That’s what Time magazine meant when it chose “The View” as the most important political show of its moment.) But “The View” worked as brilliantly as it did because it took place in a world that was post-transformation. Politics and entertainment were now one. They were conjoined. Our entertainer-in-chief hadn’t been elected yet, but the stage was set.',

        "The Chicago Cubs demoted Ryan Pressly from the closer's role in early May. He earned his first save in nearly two months Thursday in a 3-2 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates.",
      content:
        'Chicago Cubs reliever Ryan Pressly stepped out of the bullpen in the ninth inning Thursday night looking for his first save since April 13. Following a disastrous May 6 outing in which Pressly surrendered nine runs, eight earned, without recording an out in the 11th inning against the San Francisco Giants, manager Craig Counsell pulled Pressly from the closer’s role. The 36-year-old right-hander has had plenty of time to do some soul searching since then. But he was fully locked in under the lights Thursday when he retired the side in order to seal a 3-2 Cubs win over the Pittsburgh Pirates at Wrigley Field. “Sometimes you get beat pretty bad like that and you kind of want to curl up in a little ball and not say anything or do anything,” Pressly said after the win. “But if you want to prove yourself you’ve got to go back out there and keep proving to yourself that you’re good enough.” After Counsell demoted Pressly from the closer’s role, Porter Hodge briefly took over the job until an oblique injury sidelined him . Since then, Daniel Palencia had served as the closer . Counsell elected to insert Palencia into the game in the eighth inning Thursday with the heart of the Pirates order due up. Palencia worked a one-two-three inning, which set up Pressly for the save opportunity. It was Pessly’s fifth of the season but his first in nearly two months. Counsell praised Pressly’s resiliency in battling through both the adversity and a knee injury. This is a closer who was on the mound for the final outs of the Astros’ 2022 World Series championship. A bad outing like the one in early May caught the entire league’s attention. “I think Ryan deserves a ton of credit here for how he’s bounced back,” Counsell said. “If you look at his season, he’s had one bad inning. That inning resulted in some changes on our end and he’s put up zeros ever since. It’s just a lesson, man, to all of us as to what it means to be a professional and how this game, it’s going to knock you down. Are you going to stay down or are you going to get back up?” Pressly has answered that pretty definitively. He hasn’t allowed an earned run in 14 appearances since. In the meantime, he looked to his teammates for help in overcoming that tough outing. Left fielder Ian Happ wrote up a scouting report as if he were going to face Pressly. That helped identify a few tendencies that Pressly has since erased. Photos: Chicago Cubs beat Pittsburgh Pirates 3-2 at Wrigley Field “You’ve got to be humble in this game or you’re going to get humbled,” Pressly said. “I got humbled in front of the Cubbie faithful and all of MLB. You’ve just got to take that and try to have a little bit of humility and just build off of it.” Pressly closed out what proved to be starter Jameson Taillon’s seventh win of the season. Taillon worked 6 1/3 innings, allowing four hits and two earned runs while striking out seven and walking two.

(Chris Sweda/Chicago Tribune) The Cubs took a 3-0 lead following a two-run home run from center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong in the fourth inning and a solo shot from designated hitter Seiya Suzuki in the sixth. Taillon left the game after giving up a run in the seventh. Righty reliever Brad Keller inherited runners on first and second with one out. He struck out Pirates left fielder Tommy Pham for the second out, but then proceeded to hit a batter, loading the bases. He then allowed a run to score on a four-pitch, bases-loaded walk.

There’s going to be some craziness happen. There’s going to be some bad luck maybe or whatever. The next pitch can be super important.” That paved the way for Palencia and Pressly to close out the eighth and the ninth innings. The three relievers didn’t allow a hit, continuing a trend for a bullpen that has been the best in the majors since May 14. The Cubs opened a 10-game homestand with a win and improved to 42-27. “Whatever opportunity (Counsell) wants to put me in, I just want to help this team win,” Pressly said. “Saving games is fun and cool and stuff, but winning’s a lot more fun to me. I don’t care who’s pitching in the ninth, I just want to win.” On Thursday, Pressly did both.',

        'A former Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, has submitted that Nigeria can not be said to be practising full democracy yet.According to him, Nigeria only returned to civilian rule in 1999 but is still on a journey to real democracy.Naija News reports Fayemi made the submission on Thursday during a Channels Television special June 12 event tagged ‘Nigeria’s Democratic Journey: An Inter-Generational Conversation On Building A Better Nation.’According to him, what happened to Nigeria in 1999 was simply the right to vote for its leaders, which he described as semi-democracy. He said true democracy is a journey, and Nigeria is not there yet.“What we mustn’t do is to conflate elections with democracy. What we got was to reestablish the right to vote for our leaders into office in 1999, what we are yet to get is real democracy in my view.“We got civilian rule, we are proudly on the journey — we now have a semi-democracy, but now we don’t have full democracy. The effort that the previous president and now President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has put into it, we all must build on that,” he said.The Fight For DemocracyGoing down memory lane, Fayemi recalled the struggles he and other fighters for democracy had to endure to propagate their activities and other democracy campaigns under the regime of the late former military dictator, Sani Abacha.Specifically, he recalled how they operated Radio Kudirat, with some people dying in the process.The former Governor said those of them who survived were not smarter, but only lucky not to be killed by the military government at the time.He said, “It’s not that we were not afraid or we were aimlessly bold, we just didn’t fully think of the enormity of the threat it constituted beyond wanting to do the right thing.“I mean, I carried the transmitters of Radio Kudirat on an Air France flight that was destined for Cotonou in the Benin Republic and made a detour to Lagos in the heat of the crisis.“I could have been picked up on that flight, I would have been history by now as many found themselves to be. During the Oputa Panel Commission, some of the characters that were mandated to eliminate leaders of the struggle came up with their stories.“So, we shouldn’t make light of what happened and I don’t by any stretch of imagination want to create the impression that we were invincible in what we did, I think some of us are just fortunate that we are still alive. Those who lost their lives were not stupid in what they did, they were following their convictions.”Fayemi, however, hailed President Tinubu for recognising some of the actors in the democracy struggle on Thursday with national awards, but urged that more people, including the Radio Kudirat operators, should also be recognised.The post Nigeria Only Has Semi-democracy For Now – Fayemi appeared first on Naija News.',

      content:
        'A US appeals court has temporarily blocked a federal judge\'s order that directed President Donald Trump to return control of National Guard troops to California after he deployed them there following protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals said it would hold a hearing on the matter on June 17. The ruling came just hours after a federal judge\'s order was to take effect at noon Friday, local time. Donald Trump deployed troops from California\'s National Guard to LA. Earlier on Thursday, US District Judge Charles Breyer ruled the Guard deployment was illegal, violating the Tenth Amendment and exceeding Trump\'s statutory authority. The order applied only to the National Guard troops and not Marines who were also deployed to the LA protests. The judge said he would not rule on the Marines because they were not out on the streets yet. Newsom praised earlier ruling California Governor Gavin Newsom, who had asked the judge for an emergency stop to troops helping carry out immigration raids, had praised the earlier ruling. In 1992 the National Guard was called into Los Angeles help control widespread, destructive rioting, but the situation right now is very different. "Today was really about a test of democracy, and today we passed the test," he said in a news conference before the appeals court decision. The White House had called Breyer\'s order "unprecedented" and said it "puts our brave federal officials in danger". "The district court has no authority to usurp the President\'s authority as Commander in Chief," White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. "The President exercised his lawful authority to [mobilise] the National Guard to protect federal buildings and personnel in Gavin Newsom\'s lawless Los Angeles. "The Trump Administration will immediately appeal this abuse of power and looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue." Protests erupted in LA over the Trump administration\'s immigration raids. Mr Newsom\'s case was solely focused on the National Guard, and the judge said when the state attorney asked about whether this could apply to the Marines that he would not rule on that because they were not on the streets yet. About 700 Marines have been undergoing civil disturbance training at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach in Orange County, California. "I have been told by the office of the governor that within the next 24 hours, 140 Marines will replace and relieve National Guard members in Los Angeles," attorney for the state Nicholas Green told the court. Judge says protests not a \'rebellion\' Typically the authority to call up the National Guard lies with governors, but there are limited circumstances under which the president can deploy those troops. Mr Trump federalised members of the California National Guard under an authority known as Title 10. A demonstrator holds a placard during the protests in LA. Title 10 allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service under certain limited circumstances, such as when the country "is invaded," when "there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government," or when the president is unable "to execute the laws of the United States". Judge Breyer said in his ruling that what is happening in Los Angeles does not meet the definition of a rebellion. "The protests in Los Angeles fall far short of \'rebellion\'," he wrote. It was not immediately clear how that would change the situation on the ground. Newsom sues to block deployment Mr Newsom sued to block the Guard\'s deployment against his wishes. California later filed an emergency motion asking the judge to block the Guard from assisting with immigration raids. California\'s governor Gavin Newsom sued to block the Guard\'s deployment. The governor argued the troops were originally deployed to guard federal buildings and called for the court to block the troops from helping protect immigration agents during the raids, saying involving the Guard would only escalate tensions and promote civil unrest. Major General Scott Sherman, commander of Task Force 51 which is overseeing the Guard troops and Marines sent to Los Angeles, said as of Wednesday about 500 Guard troops had been trained to accompany agents on immigration operations. Photos of Guard soldiers providing security for the agents have already been circulated by immigration officials. None of the Marines have been trained to go on immigration raids, and it is not yet clear if they eventually will, Mr Sherman said. A demonstrator waves a Mexican flag during a protest in LA. Trump improperly called up the Guard, judge says In his broad ruling, the judge determined Mr Trump had not properly called the Guard up in the first place. The lawsuit argued that Title 10 also requires the president go through governors when issuing orders to the National Guard. Brett Shumate, an attorney for the federal government, said Mr Trump complied with the statute by informing the general in charge of the troops of his decision and would have the authority to call in the Guard even if he had not. In a brief filed ahead of the Thursday hearing, the Justice Department said Trump\'s orders were not subject to judicial review. Depending on your politics, you could see this as either a wannabe dictator illegally trying to quash civil liberties, or local and state-level politicians trying to stymie the policy agenda of a legitimately elected president. "Courts did not interfere when President Eisenhower deployed the military to protect school desegregation," the department said. "Courts did not interfere when President Nixon deployed the military to deliver the mail in the midst of a postal strike. "And courts should not interfere here either." Judge Breyer, who at one point waved a copy of the constitution, said he disagreed. "We\'re talking about the president exercising his authority, and the president is of course limited in that authority," he said. "That\'s the difference between a constitutional government and King George."',

        'For decades, 1206 had appeared in some of the most significant moments of Rupani’s career, from his entry into politics to his tenure as chief minister For years, 1206 was more than just a number to Vijay Rupani. It was the former Gujarat chief minister’s talisman, a symbol of fortune that had guided him through the pivotal moments of his life—from his rise in Gujarat politics to personal milestones. However, on June 12, that very number—which had once brought him success and fortune—would come to mark his untimely end. On Thursday, when Rupani boarded Air India AI171, bound for London, a routine flight that would take him to his family quickly turned into a nightmare. The plane crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, taking the lives of 241 people on board and leaving just one miracle survivor. Among them was the former chief minister, whose relationship with 1206 seemed almost prophetic in its tragic irony. For decades, 1206 had appeared in some of the most significant moments of Rupani’s career, from his entry into politics to his tenure as chief minister. It had been the number on his election forms, the number of his personal cars, and even the one he used to sign personal documents. Rupani had often spoken of it with reverence, describing it as his “lucky charm," the key to his success. His supporters, too, came to see it as a good omen—something that would continue to steer him toward a bright future. However, now, the number that once signified prosperity will forever symbolise an unfathomable loss. Confirming Rupani’s death, Gujarat BJP state president CR Patil called it a “great loss" for the party. “Our leader, former Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, was also on that flight. Vijay Rupani died in this tragedy. May God grant peace to his soul. This is a great loss for the BJP family as well," Patil said. The ill-fated Air India flight struggled to gain altitude and slammed into a hostel for doctors of a medical college, immediately killing five students. What seems to have compounded the impact was the fact that the airliner was loaded with aviation fuel since it was set to fly all the way to London. It was also revealed that shortly after takeoff, the pilot sent out a “Mayday" call, but when Air Traffic Control tried to make repeated attempts to get in touch with the flight, there was no response.',

Or sign-in if you have an account. (Bloomberg) — The UK’s Office for National Statistics used to knock on doors and ask people if they were employed, as a traditional way of compiling the country’s labor market data.

Sign In or Create an Account But when Covid-19 forced social distancing in 2020, door-knocking was out. At one point during the pandemic, the survey was reliant on how many phone numbers it could find for a representative sample — and also on people actually answering their mobile phones when an unknown number called. Only a quarter of Britons say they answer such calls, with most wary of scams. Fewer that half of UK households have a landline, and those numbers can be difficult to find. Response rates plunged. By 2023, the data had become so patchy the ONS was forced to suspend its unemployment reading as it desperately sought to repair a key release that helps inform government policy, influences interest rates and drives billions of dollars of investment decisions. An ensuing crisis of confidence in Britain’s data ended with the resignation of its national statistician, Ian Diamond, last month, following fierce criticism from politicians and senior central bankers.

Getting households to pick up the phone is just one of many obstacles facing the world’s stats geeks, including government agencies tasked with collecting numbers on everything from joblessness to agricultural output. Just as cellphone users swipe away unwanted callers, people screen visitors with video doorbells and an increasing number live in apartment blocks impenetrable to data collectors, compounding a collapse in survey responses. The pandemic exacerbated most of these trends. That’s left statisticians from Australia to Britain and the US scrambling to update collection methods stuck in the 20th century without introducing new 21st century biases. The solution that agencies and pollsters, from the ONS to the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US, have zeroed in on: online surveys. These polls are less costly than telephone or face-to-face surveys, more convenient for respondents, and statistics agencies are using AI to target non-responders. Yet as agencies are finding, the big analogue-to-digital switch in economic data is throwing up new problems for the indicators global investors and policymakers rely on. “There’s no magic mode,” said Steve MacFeely, chief statistician at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. “They’re well aware of the risk and are doing it because they have no other choice. It’s the grim reality of official statistics today.” Barrage of spam Problems with the new wave of online surveys include fresh biases in the data, confusion over questions that a computer cannot address, gaining trust amid a barrage of spam and fraud in people’s inboxes, and the fact that households may be just as likely to ignore an email with an online survey as a phone call. “What you gain in coverage/response, you possibly lose in measurement quality or content features,” said Eric Harrison, deputy director of the European Social Survey. Problems with the UK’s labor market figures serve as a cautionary tale. Britain’s efforts to create a new online-led labor market survey came after the response rate to its household survey collapsed to below 15%, forcing the ONS to temporarily withdraw its key labor market estimates in late 2023. BOE rate-setters complain it is making it far more difficult to set interest rates, even with the reinstated figures. A full transition to an online questionnaire in the UK may not happen until 2027 after teething problems in testing. Early results showed the new online survey was producing significantly different readings from the existing survey that relies on telephone calls and knocking on doors, people familiar with the situation said. One potential issue is that respondents aren’t able to ask an interviewer to clarify a question they don’t understand. The ONS is looking at an AI chatbot that could help. “Moving the survey online has been challenging due to the survey length and complexity meaning many households didn’t finish it,” an ONS spokesperson said. “We’ve tested a shorter version that’s giving improved and more complete responses and this new version will go live in the field next month.” Another key risk from online surveys is that it creates new unknown biases that statisticians have to counteract. In the UK, the existing labor force survey struggled to get enough young workers to answer. For an online questionnaire, it could be the opposite problem. “If you were to do a face-to-face LFS survey, and you were to do a telephone or an online labor force survey, you’d get different results from all three,” said MacFeely from the OECD. In the US, Joanne Hsu, director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan, believes that being behind the computer screen may also skew how people respond to economic surveys. The Michigan survey’s closely watched figures on economic sentiment and inflation expectations in the US fully transitioned to a web-only mode in 2024 after seven years of testing the new responses alongside its existing phone-based method. While it helped to double the survey’s reach to nearly 1,500 responses, Hsu noticed that respondents are more likely to give extreme answers on the web — especially for inflation expectations, which recently surged to the highest in three decades. “People might think twice about giving any sort of extreme value to an interviewer,” she said. While the US has seen a smaller drop off in responses to many of its official surveys, the rate for the Current Population Survey underpinning labor statistics has fallen by almost 20 percentage points in a decade to 68%. For the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey or JOLTS report, a business survey, response rates have tumbled to almost 30%. Former US Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner William Beach said that US data could soon be in the same state as Britain’s moribund labor statistics without action to modernize its surveys. Labor force surveys “are dying, they’re decaying, they’re in very serious trouble,” Beach recently said on Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast. “Unless we modernize that survey, we will see a time when we will be like the British, unable to publish portions of it that just don’t have sufficient sample for statistical release.” Response rates to the Current Population Survey are also under pressure as President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration may be discouraging foreign-born workers from participating in the survey. Trump’s election has compounded challenges as his job cuts across the federal workforce put greater pressure on funding and staffing. The BLS and Census Bureau have been trying for years to mitigate the preexisting challenges by introducing a web-response mode for households to their CPS — which produces the unemployment and participation rates, among other statistics, in the monthly jobs report. Interviews currently are mostly conducted over the phone or in person. The agencies are barely hanging onto the CPS’s sample size, which the BLS said last year was at risk of getting cut due to budget constraints. Advocacy groups successfully lobbied Congress for additional funds, which keeps the status quo for now, but still lacks necessary additional investment for the web transition. BLS and Census say the internet option will boost response rates, or at least stabilize them. For statisticians facing pressures on multiple fronts, online surveys seem to be the least-worst option, rather than the cure-all. Canada’s national statistics body has run an online survey for its labor data since 2015, alongside face-to-face and telephone interviews. It has seen a smaller decline in responses for its mandatory labor market survey than the plunges seen elsewhere and relies on targeting households with a bespoke strategy and contacting them ahead of time to keep response rates high. “I think in the context of that gradual decline, the electronic questionnaire is an attractive option for busy couples or for busy families,” said Vincent Dale, director general of labor market, education and socioeconomic well-being at Statistics Canada. Dale said slowly declining response rates in Canada was down “to things like trusting government, changing lifestyles meaning two earner families so less people at home during the day, [and] use of cell phones makes it more difficult to contact people.” The Australian Bureau of Statistics is also taking a multi-prong approach after noting declining response rates in both business and household surveys. The ABS is modernizing its data acquisition processes to make it easier for people to respond quickly, including mobile-friendly surveys, and investing in “alternatives to traditional surveys.” “Without continued modernization of data acquisition, including contemporary online surveys and increased use of administrative data, we would see rising costs and falling response rates with a corresponding drop in quality of survey estimates,” an ABS spokesperson said. “Lower quality data becomes a barrier to making well-informed decisions.” —With assistance from Irina Anghel.

        "June 13 (UPI) -- Leon Draisaitl fired a one-handed shot off Niko Mikkola and into the net, helping the Edmonton Oilers rally from a 3-0 deficit to stun the Florida Panthers in overtime Thursday in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Final. \"Obviously, it was a fortunate bounce, but we'll take these right now,\" Draisaitl said on the TNT broadcast after the 5-4 victory in Sunrise, Fla. The Oilers allowed three first-period goals before fighting back for a 4-3 lead, but the Panthers forced overtime with just 20 seconds remaining in regulation at Amerant Bank Arena. Draisaitl then played hero, setting an NHL record with his fourth overtime goal and tying the best-of-seven game series 2-2. \"We'd like to put ourselves into better situations first off so we don't constantly have to fight back and hang in there and scratch and claw our way back, but it is a great characteristic of our team,\" Draisaitl said. Draisaitl logged two assists, in addition to his latest game-winner. Fellow forwards Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Vasily Podkolzi registered a goal and assist apiece. Calvin Pickard , who replaced benched goaltender Stuart Skinner to start the second period, made 22 saves over 51:18 on ice. \"We play great hockey from behind,\" Pickard said. \"It was an unbelievable effort, obviously. Giving up that late goal was not ideal, but we regrouped and got a bounce.\" Panthers goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky made 30 saves. Matthew Tkachuk scored twice and logged an assist. Fellow Panthers forward Sam Reinhart logged a goal and two assists. Early penalties and offensive aggression from the Panthers hurt the Oilers. Tkachuk lit the lamp for first blood off a 5-on-3 power play 11:40 into the night. Fellow forward Aleksander Barkov started the play by winning a face off inside the left circle. Tkachuk recovered the puck and unwound a wrist shot past Skinner's glove side. Barkov earned another assist off a Tkachuk score about five minutes later. The Panthers captain fired an initial pass to Tkachuk on the right side of the net. Tkachuk then fed Reinhart, who hit a shot at Skinner. The puck bounced off the net minder and was corralled by Tkachuk, who buried a follow up behind the Oilers goalie. Reinhart and Carter Verhaeghe assisted a third Panthers goal with 42 seconds remaining in the first period. Verhaeghe won possession behind the Oilers' net and fired a pass through the slot, finding Anton Lundell for a one-timer for the 3-0 lead. The Panthers outshot the Oilers 13-2 through the first 14 minutes and 17-7 in the first period. Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch then elected to bench Skinner in favor of Pickard. The Oilers' offense also woke up in the bridge frame, outshooting the Panthers 9-1 over the next 10 minutes. Draisaitl and Connor McDavid assisted Nugent-Hopkins for their first score off a power play 3:33 into the second period. Defenseman Darnell Nurse cut the deficit to one with another Oilers score with 7:13 remaining in the period. Podkolzin tied the score for the Oilers less than three minutes later. Draisaitl and Nurse assisted that score. The Oilers outshot the Panthers 17-10 in the second period to tie the score heading into the third. Pickard had 10 saves in the second period. Panthers forwards flocked to the Oilers' net early in the final frame, but couldn't convert. Nugent-Hopkins and Kasperi Kapanen then fed defenseman Jake Walman for a vicious one-timer inside the right circle with 6:24 remaining for the Oilers' first lead of Game 4. The Panthers pulled Bobrovsky with 2:26 remaining in an attempt to net a game-tying score. Reinhart came through when he beat Pickard with a wrist shot with 20 seconds left, forcing overtime for the third time in the series. Panthers defenseman Gustav Forsling nearly won the game with a one-timer about a minute into overtime, but missed wide. He went on to save a potential game-winning score by the Oilers with his left skate just seconds later. Pickard deflected another shot from Panthers forward Sam Bennett, which drilled the crossbar on another attempt about five minutes later. That shot proved the be the Panthers' best chance at a late winner. Podkolzin sent a pass from left to right to Corey Perry above the slot to start the final exchange. Perry flicked the puck on to Draisaitl, who carried the puck on his stick with just his right hand. Draisaitl shielded off defenseman A.J. Greer before sliding the puck off Mikkola and through Bobrovsky's legs. The Oilers and Panthers will face off in Game 5 of the best-of-seven game series at 8 p.m. EDT Saturday in Edmonton. \"Obviously we've got a work ahead of us here,\" Draisaitl said. \"I'll take it, but bigger picture.\"",

        'Before the Club World Cup, The Athletic has spoken to dozens of people to gain a clearer picture of the most powerful man in football',
      content:
        'Inside the White House, President Trump was on a roll. “Amazing,” he said. “He’s like somebody who just woke up on Christmas morning as a young child and saw those toys under the tree. And that enthusiasm plays very well, I have to say.” Gianni Infantino threw his head back in laughter before smiling and nodding along, looking delighted by the United States president’s description of him. It was the same a couple of months earlier at the launch of a White House Task Force for the 2026 World Cup, when Donald Trump described the FIFA president as “my great friend” and “sort of the king of soccer... I guess... in a certain way”. Advertisement He is. Sort of. I guess. In a certain way. As the head of FIFA, football’s governing body, Infantino is the most powerful figure in the sport, able to make what sound like wild, off-the-cuff proposals — a 32-team Club World Cup, a 48-team World Cup — and make them a reality while travelling around the world on a Qatari private jet, rubbing shoulders with sporting superstars and heads of state, sharing his adventures with his three million Instagram followers and frequently resembling the excited child of Trump’s description. “Living football, uniting the world through football and making football truly global,” he says on his Instagram profile. He has also taken to describing FIFA as “an official provider of happiness to humanity”. He has come to be characterised by journalists in his native Switzerland as football’s new ‘Sonnenkonig’ — the sun king, evoking Louis XIV, the vainglorious 18th-century king of France. Infantino’s name appears (twice) on the new Club World Cup trophy, designed by luxury jeweller Tiffany & Co. A small team follows him at almost every turn, ready to record his movements for his social media accounts. As the Infantino brand grows, one is reminded of something Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football’s governing body UEFA, pointedly said in a press conference a few years back: “No football administrator, no matter the size of the ego, should think we are the stars of the game — because we are not.” It is all a far cry from the days when Infantino was known primarily as the unsmiling, slightly awkward UEFA bureaucrat who would offer platitudes on stage during Champions League draws (“Galatasaray... the Turkish champions of course, semi-finalists in 1989”). Nobody saw him as FIFA president-in-waiting a decade ago when a succession of corruption scandals brought down Sepp Blatter’s regime. Among many of those who worked alongside him at UEFA, there is astonishment at the way Infantino first seized power and quickly learned to embrace it. Advertisement So, who is the real Gianni Infantino? Is this the delightful underdog story of a football-mad guy who overcame prejudice and humble beginnings, as the son of Italian immigrants in Switzerland, to rise to the top of the sport and clean up FIFA? Or is it a Machiavellian story about the pursuit of power, about campaigning hard on a reformist ticket and then allowing the game, once more, to be kicked about like a geopolitical football? With his beloved 32-team Club World Cup about to kick off in Miami this weekend, amid concerns about low ticket sales and player fatigue , The Athletic has spoken to dozens of people within FIFA circles, past and present, to gain a clearer impression of Infantino; of what he has and has not achieved since his election in 2016. We have heard glowing testimonies (“brilliant”) from some and withering assessments (“an empty suit”) from others. Some of our interviewees were willing to speak publicly, while others did so on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships. We have visited Infantino’s home town of Brig-Glis, in the Swiss Alps, to hear from locals, including a family member, and the portrait that emerges is a confusing one — not least because some of those who worked with him previously and happily championed his bid for the FIFA presidency feel he has changed beyond recognition. “I don’t recognise the Gianni I see and hear now,” says one football administrator who worked closely with Infantino at UEFA. “What I don’t know is if this is the real Gianni Infantino or if nine years in this job has done this to him.” Beyond his multi-lingual flair, his energy and his political instincts, one of the few things everyone recognises in him is the wide-eyed enthusiasm that Trump mentioned. Whether for better or worse, whether mingling with footballers or with heads of state, that child-like vigour has never left him. Infantino by name, infantino by nature. They called him ‘Piccolo’, little one. Gianni Infantino, the youngest of three children, was born in Switzerland in 1970 with health complications and required a blood transfusion in infancy. He told reporters in 2016 that the blood that saved his life came from two donors: one in Bristol, England, and the other in Belgrade, which in those days was the capital of Yugoslavia. Advertisement He was born in Switzerland and survived thanks to English and Serbian blood. But he grew up feeling Italian. His father, Vincenzo, was from Calabria, on the ‘toe’ of the Italian mainland, and his mother, Maria, from the mountains of eastern Lombardy. They lived together in the northern town of Domodossola, at the foot of the Alps, before leaving in search of a new life in Switzerland. Domodossola is at the Italian end of the 12-mile tunnel that cuts through the Alps under the Simplon Pass. At the Swiss end is the picturesque town of Brig-Glis, seemingly an idyllic setting at the heart of Europe. Infantino’s cousin, Daniel Nellen, talks of growing up there “with this international feeling — you know this internationality from (when you are) young, you know?”. But that new life in Switzerland brought challenges for many migrants from Italy, particularly those who, like Vincenzo, had come from the poorer regions in the south. “(From) The Swiss, we felt this racism,” Nellen tells The Athletic at his hair salon in Brig. “Gianni had red hair and his skin had freckles. This was not too much of a big problem. The problem more was (being) Italian.” Infantino touched on this in his infamous “Today I feel...” speech in Qatar on the eve of the men’s World Cup in 2022. He spoke about how, faced with discrimination, “you lock yourself down, you went to your room, you cry”. His family were poor by Brig’s affluent standards. Vincenzo worked on the night rail service. “Work three days, go, stay one night and come back,” Nellen says. “When he had days off, he worked in the kiosk at the station with Gianni’s mother, selling newspapers and cigarettes. Then he would go again with the train to Rome, Paris, Brussels.” Nellen says Infantino’s intelligence was “crazy”. “Learning was so easy for Gianni,” he says. “He came home (from school) and the first thing he would do was open up Gazzetta dello Sport, the Italian sports newspaper: the results of the games, the matches... sport, sport, sport, football, football, football.” Advertisement Gianni supported the Italian giants Inter, idolising Evaristo Beccalossi and Alessandro Altobelli. His own football ambitions did not progress beyond the third team at FC Brig-Glis, but, as his cousin Nellen puts it, “he started to organise, look for sponsorship and look for shirts... He liked to organise”. An early glimpse of his appetite for football administration and politics came when he proposed that FC Brig-Glis integrate another team, Folgore, made up of second-generation immigrants, into the club. “He convinced the president and the other members to vote yes,” Nellen says. “I don’t think that when you are 20 years old, you think about becoming FIFA president. But he said, ‘If I’m not good enough (to be a footballer), I want to be the lawyer of the footballer’. Always, his idea was to make something with football.” In the 121-year history of FIFA, only nine men have held the office of president. What are the chances that the last two would be born six miles apart? Blatter, born in Visp, and Infantino belong to different generations and had different academic backgrounds — the former in business and economics from the University of Lausanne, the latter in law from the University of Fribourg — but both were drawn towards what David Conn, in The Fall of the House of FIFA, calls “the graduate class of Swiss administrators educated to service the forest of sports governing bodies nestling in the country”. Infantino landed a job as legal counsel and general secretary of the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) in the Swiss city of Neuchatel. The work brought him into contact with FIFA, but no role at football’s global HQ was forthcoming. At age 30, after two years at CIES, he got a job in UEFA’s legal department. Dan O’Toole, UEFA’s former brand manager, recalls him as an “amiable, well-mannered colleague” who “got on well with whoever I saw him talking to”. Advertisement “In the early years, we used to go out socially and go around to his house,” O’Toole (not to be confused with the FIFA executive of the same name) tells The Athletic at a cafe on the banks of Lake Geneva near UEFA’s headquarters.“He was quiet, if anything. Not shy, just sort of quiet.” An English football executive recalls encountering Infantino in those days and initially finding him so unremarkable that he must be “one of the bag carriers”. But Infantino came to life in meetings and in the company of senior figures. “For example, at an airport, surrounded by ExCo (executive committee) members, the way he could hold them all in the palm of his hand by telling jokes in five or six different languages, which to me was off the scale,” O’Toole says. Infantino’s stock at UEFA rose under the presidency of legendary French footballer Michel Platini. “There was quite a meteoric rise through the ranks,” O’Toole says. “The Gianni I remember was polite, earnest, hard-working, but could be fun, too,” says Alex Horne, general secretary of the English Football Association between 2010 and 2015, in a telephone interview. “There were times when we wanted one thing, maybe Germany wanted something else, and the others had all their views, too, but Gianni and Theo (Theodoris, UEFA’s deputy general secretary) would make it work.” They were an effective trio, but, according to two figures who attended meetings with UEFA at the time, Platini had limited time for his general secretary’s views on on-field matters. One area of difference was video assistant referees (VAR); Infantino was a devotee, his boss a committed sceptic. There was no doubt where the power lay. As the Blatter regime down the road at FIFA began to crumble, Platini became the heir apparent. Infantino’s best hope, it seemed, was to keep holding on to his boss’s coat-tails. By mid-summer of 2015, FIFA was in meltdown. Platini was the overwhelming favourite to take over from Blatter and the race was on to find Platini’s successor at UEFA. The strong favourite was Wolfgang Niersbach, the German FA president, who had significant support among the most influential European nations. Advertisement From the outside, Infantino seemed a likely candidate to follow Platini to FIFA and become general secretary. But according to people working at UEFA at the time, that was unlikely to have been Platini’s plan. Niersbach, likewise, was planning a new leadership team at UEFA. Infantino’s future was suddenly in doubt. So too was Platini’s coronation when, in September 2015, Swiss prosecutors opened an investigation into a payment of two million Swiss francs (CHF; $2.43million/£1.8million at today’s exchange rates) he received from FIFA four years earlier. Swiss prosecutors alleged that the payment, authorised by Blatter and said to relate to work Platini had carried out between 1999 and 2002, was “unfavourable to FIFA”. Blatter and Platini have since been cleared of charges relating to the payment, most recently at a Swiss federal criminal appeals court this year, but FIFA’s ethics committee banned both men from all football activities in December 2015 for eight years, later reduced to six years on appeal. When Infantino first announced his intention to run for the FIFA presidency, many imagined he was merely an interim candidate while Platini looked to clear his name. But as the February 2016 election drew closer, it became clear that his ambitions were very real. “He embarked on the most exhaustive campaign,” Greg Dyke, chairman of the English FA between 2013 and 2016 , tells The Athletic at a cafe in west London. “He went everywhere. He was very amusing about it, about the airlines he had been on and the rest of it. I thought he would be a good choice.” Why? “Because I had always liked him at FIFA,” Dyke says. “I thought he was straight and a good organiser. International football isn’t that full of straight people... and I always felt Infantino was straight.” Infantino launched his campaign in London, joined at Wembley Stadium by big-name coaches (Jose Mourinho, Fabio Capello) and ex-players (Luis Figo, Roberto Carlos, Clarence Seedorf) and bringing endorsements from others. It was an early glimpse of his contacts at the top end of the game and his willingness to flaunt them. But what really resonated among the FIFA electorate, perhaps more than his pledge to “clean” FIFA, was Infantino’s promise to increase the money distributed to each member association to $5m (£3.7m) over the next four years. “The money of FIFA is your money,” he told them in his final speech before they cast their votes. It seemed to draw far louder applause than anything he had said about reform, integrity and governance. This extra money, he said, would come from expanding FIFA’s existing tournaments. He proposed a 40-team men’s World Cup (since revised further to 48) and a 32-team men’s Club World Cup. Bigger tournaments would mean a bigger product to sell to broadcasters and commercial partners. Questions about the increased demands on players, in an already congested fixture calendar, were brushed aside. As the results were read out and his victory confirmed, Infantino closed his eyes, clasped his hands and touched his left breast. “We will restore the image of FIFA and the respect of FIFA,” he declared. “And everyone in the world will applaud us.” Follow the Club World Cup on The Athletic this summer... There is little regard for Blatter or the FIFA regime he presided over, but a familiar observation is that he had a certain old-school charm. By contrast, Blatter’s successor is characterised as a man in a hurry, too busy to dwell too long on pleasantries. Infantino is close to some of his staff, but to others at FIFA’s Zurich headquarters , he is a remote figure. Advertisement A sense of detachment is inevitable when Infantino spends so much of his time jetsetting, visiting member associations and dotting about FIFA’s new offices in Paris, Miami and Singapore. But to some, this reflects a particular modern workplace archetype: so fixated on climbing upwards that he has little time to look down. Some of those close to Infantino refute this description, describing the married father of four as extremely courteous and saying that he enquires about staff members’ well-being and families out of genuine interest. Beyond that, they say he is at his most relaxed when talking about football, chatting with friends and colleagues over a beer in an Italian restaurant — or indeed taking a spontaneous trip to watch Millwall play Norwich City while in London for an International Football Association Board (IFAB) meeting in 2023. His obsession with football — and, more than that, football politics — is said to come at the exclusion of much else. One football executive says, “I’ve never heard him talk about a book or a movie or mention any other sport. He just lives for this role.” Even those closest to Infantino do not dispute that his demanding nature has ruffled feathers at FIFA. One source describes him as a “red” personality type: demanding, strong-willed, assertive, dynamic, fast-paced, results-focused, action-oriented. Long-winded or hesitant responses in meetings meet with a curt response. “He has absolutely no time for bullshit,” one person says. The picture that emerges calls to mind the ruthless, uncompromising, relentless, go-getting C-suite guru of LinkedIn caricature, which was far from his image when he was climbing the corporate ladder at UEFA. Some of those “red” personality traits are recognised by a former UEFA colleague but back then, he was regarded as more of a “blue” — analytical, logical, detail-oriented, albeit with a work ethic, ambitious streak and political instinct that many underestimated. “I don’t think it was Gianni’s burning ambition at the time (to be FIFA president),” Horne says. “Maybe he was a great poker player and I misjudged him, but I think he ended up in charge almost by accident.” Upon his election in 2016, Infantino’s sister Daniela told Swiss newspaper Der Bund that he was a “very sensitive, harmonious person” who still called his mother every night. “He will not suddenly take off and fly to another planet when he comes FIFA president,” she said. “I don’t see him as a careerist who would walk over dead bodies for his success.” Advertisement Thomas Renggli, a journalist who was briefly employed by FIFA under Blatter’s presidency, feels Infantino “was always one step ahead.” “Nobody expected him to play a role in this game, but I’m pretty sure he had a very smart plan,” he says at a cafe in Zurich. “He played like chess. The king and queen, they were out of the game — and then all of a sudden, Gianni was there.” In April this year, a high-powered delegation — including U.S. attorney general Pam Bondi and FBI director Kash Patel — arrived at FIFA’s new offices in Coral Gables on the outskirts of Miami. There was, among Infantino and his colleagues, a certain pride in the symbolic nature of these discussions surrounding the Club World Cup and World Cup on U.S. soil — and in how significantly things at FIFA had changed since a three-year FBI investigation led to a 6am raid on the five-star Baur au Lac hotel to arrest seven FIFA executives. The FIFA that Infantino walked into was a byword for corruption. As former FBI director James B Comey said in a statement in 2015, “undisclosed payments, kickbacks and bribes became a way of doing business”. Late last year, in a statement, FIFA said it had “transformed from a toxic institution to a respected, trusted and modern governing body”. Infantino, though, was barely a month into the FIFA presidency when he was named in the leaked ‘Panama Papers’ in relation to broadcast rights contracts he signed while at UEFA with an offshore company. He declared himself “dismayed” that his integrity was “being doubted by certain areas of the media”. A UEFA spokesperson said in a statement at the time that the rights were sold following an “open, competitive, tender process”. In 2020, federal prosecutors announced a separate investigation amid “indications of criminal conduct” relating to complaints made against Infantino, the former Swiss attorney general Michael Lauber, and Infantino’s childhood friend Rinaldo Arnold, a regional prosecutor. The investigation was finally dismissed and closed in 2023, with Infantino declaring “a full and clear victory for me, for the new FIFA and for justice”. In a statement, he added that “poor, envious and corrupt people” had been trying to smear his reputation. Advertisement FIFA’s own ethics committee — an independent, judicial body within the organisation — had also investigated Infantino over a potential conflict of interest in 2017 when he and his staff travelled in private jets laid on for him in Russia and Qatar. Another investigation in 2016 centred on his alleged billing of FIFA for personal expenses, including mattresses at his home, a stepper exercise machine and flowers. In both cases, the investigatory chamber concluded the ethics code had not been violated. Mark Pieth, who, in 2011, was appointed chair of an independent governance committee to oversee the reform of FIFA, tells The Athletic in a telephone interview that he lost hope in Infantino’s regime after the FIFA congress unanimously passed a resolution in May 2016 giving its new council the power to appoint or “dismiss any office holders” of its various independent committees. Compliance committee chairman Domenico Scala resigned within 24 hours of the congress, which Infantino told Swiss newspaper Le Matin was “infantile behaviour that belongs in the playground”. Hans-Joachim Eckert, a German judge who had been appointed chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of the FIFA ethics committee, and Swiss investigator Cornel Borbely were subsequently informed that their services would not be retained. “Certainly, with the independence of the ethics committee, there was a danger that we would investigate anyone who violated the code and take appropriate measures without fear or favour,” Eckert tells The Athletic via email in May. FIFA says it has always respected the decisions of committee members and denies trying to exert undue influence in any such processes. There was an unedifying episode after a recording was leaked to German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in 2016 of a conversation in which Infantino appeared to describe an offer of a CHF 2million salary as an “insult”. The FIFA president told his “enemies want to make me look greedy” and “these theories are not proven”. His salary has since doubled to nearly $5m. Then there is the prospect of Infantino staying in situ until 2031, which would take him to 15 years, even though FIFA voted in 2016 to restrict presidents to a maximum of three four-year terms. In 2022, he announced the FIFA council had agreed his first term as president would not count towards the three-term limit because, having taken over from Blatter, he only served three years of his first term. Advertisement A senior football administrator, who has worked closely with him, praises Infantino’s “considerable talents” but describes his FIFA presidency as a disappointment. “These sports leaders are treated like royalty and it goes to their heads,” the administrator says. “It’s like living in a medieval court and their imperious behaviour is rewarded.” FIFA maintains it has undergone a “deeply rooted governance and financial management reform with a clear focus on transparency”, recognised by various other institutions. Some are not convinced.“This organisation never wanted to be reformed,” believes Pieth. “They talked about reform, but they never had an aspiration to be reformed.” Eckert, too, is damning. “I can still hear his (Infantino’s) speech at the congress: everything will be better, corruption will be fought, football clean. That’s why he was elected,” he says. “I would rather not dwell on the consequences.” At the CONMEBOL Conference Centre in Asuncion, Paraguay, on May 15, the mood was restless. The 75th FIFA Congress was due to start at 9.30am local time and delegates from 210 member associations were in place. But their host was nowhere to be seen. Instead, the delegates got an email telling them the start of congress had been shifted back three hours due to “unforeseen circumstances”. Infantino was still en route to Asuncion — on a Qatari private jet from Doha, where he had spent the previous days with President Trump, attending meetings and state dinners alongside the Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Infantino eventually arrived, apologising for the delay, explaining that “as president of FIFA, my responsibility is to make decisions in the interests of the organisation” and citing “an issue with our flight”. Advertisement It prompted a walkout from eight European members of the council, including UEFA president Ceferin. In a statement, European football’s governing body expressed dismay that the timetable had been “changed at the last minute for what appears to be simply to accommodate private political interests” at the expense of the game. It was a remarkable episode — and an embarrassing one for Infantino, inviting further questions about his cosy-looking relationship with Trump . Last month, Infantino was seen nodding approvingly in the Oval Office in May as Trump told reporters that tensions between the U.S. and its 2026 World Cup co-hosts Canada and Mexico would make the tournament “more exciting” because “tension is a good thing”. Infantino also laughed along with Trump’s proposal to rename the Gulf of Mexico “the Gulf of America” at his inauguration in January. On both occasions, Infantino’s reaction caused unhappiness among some on the FIFA council. “He prefers to meet Trump in Saudi Arabia and doesn’t give a damn, to be frank, about his colleagues waiting for them,” Pieth says. “He makes them wait for three hours to even start a congress. He’s so full of himself now.” Some in FIFA circles call it Realpolitik, suggesting Infantino’s relationships with Trump and the authoritarian regimes in Saudi Arabia and Qatar are entirely pragmatic. He has refuted that line about “private political interests”, calling his relationship with Trump “crucial” within the context of next year’s World Cup — and likewise with Saudi Arabia, as thoughts turn to 2034. One source cites a speech Infantino gave in front of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh last month about the importance of investing in women’s football. To be able to do that in Saudi Arabia, whose women’s national team only played their first matches in 2022, is considered within FIFA to be an endorsement of Infantino’s ability to engage with the kingdom at the highest level. But there is, among others, an unease around the Saudi relationship and the way Infantino and FIFA seemed to clear the way for the kingdom to host the 2034 World Cup. A FIFA evaluation report classed Saudi Arabia’s human rights record as only a “medium” risk, prompting Human Rights Watch to accuse FIFA of “utter negligence” in its responsibility to the millions of migrant workers who will build the stadiums and infrastructure the tournament requires. Advertisement A joint statement by 35 signatories last month, co-ordinated by London-based human rights group FairSquare, accused FIFA of being “arguably more poorly governed today than a decade ago”. Among eight examples it cited were a lack of diversity in senior roles, Infantino’s close relationships with “authoritarian” political leaders, a wide range of human rights violations directly linked to the hosting of World Cups, and the controversial award of the 2034 men’s World Cup to Saudi Arabia. A letter sent in April from FIFA general secretary Mattias Grafstrom to Human Rights Watch, shared with The Athletic in May, detailed Saudi Arabia’s reforms to its labour laws and added: “In that respect, and in line with its human rights commitments, FIFA seeks to play its part in ensuring strong protections for workers employed by third parties in the construction of FIFA World Cup sites.” Infantino was also accused by human rights campaign groups of being too close to Qatar in the build-up to the 2022 World Cup, repeatedly rejecting criticism of the country’s record. There were also raised eyebrows at his fawning over President Putin before, during and after the 2018 World Cup in Russia, accepting an “order of friendship” medal and telling the world, “This is a new image of Russia that we now have.” Within four years, FIFA had suspended Russia from its competitions until further notice after the country’s invasion of Ukraine. What is indisputable is the huge amount of commercial revenue FIFA has extracted from, for example, Aramco, the state-owned Saudi energy company; Qatar Airways; and most recently, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which stepped up last week as a sponsor for the Club World Cup. The London-based Pitch Marketing Group released a report this week predicting FIFA’s revenues for the four-year cycle to the 2026 World Cup will exceed $10billion , more than double the amount it earned in the four years before Russia 2018. “The fact they’re going to double revenue from one cycle to the next is quite a phenomenal achievement,” says Andrew Pragnell, chief executive of the New Zealand FA. “When you look at what FIFA have done, particularly in terms of the redistribution of wealth across all of football, Gianni has represented that really well. I could list 100 challenges, but those outcomes are quite material. “If you take a pure kind of Western democracy view, you can say, ‘Ah, it’s too lenient here, he’s avoiding that issue there’. But he’s effectively managing the United Nations, right? There are 210 countries. Diving into some of those issues, it’s not an easy role. I don’t think you can ever quite (judge) someone unless you’ve walked in those shoes.” “Today I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arab. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel (like) a migrant worker.” Two and a half years have passed since Infantino’s 57-minute address on the eve of the 2022 World Cup, which he began with an unexpected riff about empathising with oppressed groups — as a son of poorly treated migrant workers in Switzerland, “bullied” for his Italian roots, ginger hair and freckles — before suggesting that criticism of his Qatari hosts’ human rights record must be down to Islamophobia. Advertisement It is fascinating how often that speech comes up when asking people for their observations of Infantino. One football executive recalls it as “embarrassing”, another (who is otherwise largely supportive of him) as “a very big communications mistake”. But another figure in FIFA circles says it came from the heart and was “incredibly brave” — not just the words but the way he hugged Bryan Swanson, his director of media relations, who spoke up about how, as a gay man, he was grateful for Infantino’s support. Since that day, Infantino has barely engaged with the media. His flurries of posts on Instagram, with public comments disabled, directly contrast his lack of engagement with mainstream media outlets. The traditional post-congress news conference has been abandoned, while numerous Club World Cup promotional events in the U.S. this week have been conducted without mainstream media access. Reporters who gathered for a trailed appearance from Infantino in Miami on Thursday were instead shown a six-minute video of the president. His only notable interview in recent times was with the American streamer Speed, who was content to build up towards the big one (“Messi or Ronaldo?”) before allowing the FIFA president to spend precisely eight minutes watching footage of him playing in the recent Sidemen charity match at Wembley. The idea behind that interview was to connect with a different audience and to try to promote the looming Club World Cup, the success of which matters so much for his credibility. It was a curious performance. Infantino’s party piece was to reveal the new Club World Cup trophy — the one with his name on it (twice) — and to produce a key to unlock its moving features. “What the hell? That’s tight,” Speed responded, almost echoing Trump’s, “Wow, you gotta be kidding” a couple of weeks earlier. And at this stage, seeing Speed’s eyes light up, Infantino seemed to be in his element — in a football world without cynicism, where everything he says is taken at face value, where he is recognised as “sort of king of soccer — I guess... in a certain way” and where that enthusiasm, as Trump put it, plays very well.

        'A U.S. appeals court has temporarily allowed President Trump to maintain National Guard deployment in Los Angeles amid immigration enforcement protests, pausing a lower court ruling. This decision keeps command with the president for now, pending a hearing on Tuesday.',
      content:
        "A U.S. appeals court on Thursday allowed President Donald Trump to maintain his deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles amid protests over stepped-up immigration enforcement, temporarily pausing a lower court ruling that blocked the mobilization. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision does not mean that the court will ultimately agree with Trump, but it does leave command of the Guard with the president for now. Earlier on Thursday, San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found that Trump's deployment of the Guard was unlawful. Breyer had ordered the National Guard to return to the control of California Governor Gavin Newsom, who had brought the case. It was a brief victory for Newsom, as Breyer's order was paused a short time later. The three-judge panel that paused the ruling consisted of two judges appointed by Trump in his first term and one judge who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden. The panel said it would hold a hearing on Tuesday to consider the merits of Breyer's order. The appeals court decision stands to leave in place the dynamic of weeklong street demonstrations that have been concentrated in downtown Los Angeles, largely at a federal detention center where National Guard troops have stood watch. The Guard had also accompanied Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on operations. In his ruling, Breyer wrote that the presence of the troops in the city was itself inflaming tensions with protesters - a contention made by Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, among others -and depriving the state of the ability to use the Guard for other purposes. That ruling came hours after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem pledged to liberate Los Angeles at a press conference that was dramatically interrupted when federal agents dragged Democratic U.S. Senator Alex Padilla out of the room, forced him to the ground and handcuffed him. The court battle and press conference scuffle underscored the political polarization generated by Trump's hardline approach to immigration enforcement and expansive use of presidential power. Trump is carrying out a campaign promise to deport immigrants, employing forceful tactics consistent with the norm-breaking political style that got him elected twice. Between the rulings, Newsom said the National Guard would be redeployed to its previous tasks, including border security, preparing for wildfires and countering drug smuggling. But the Trump administration immediately appealed the judge's order, calling Breyer's ruling an extraordinary intrusion on the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief. Trump justified the deployment of troops by characterizing the protests in Los Angeles as a rebellion, but Breyer said in a temporary restraining order that the protests fell far short of that legal standard. The Court is troubled by the implication inherent in Defendants' argument that protest against the federal government, a core civil liberty protected by the First Amendment, can justify a finding of rebellion, Breyer wrote. Trump has said if he had not ordered in the National Guard the city would be in flames. The protests so far have been mostly peaceful, punctuated by incidents of violence and restricted to a few city blocks. Trump summoned the National Guard on Saturday, then the U.S. Marines on Monday, to help federal police forces guard federal buildings from protesters and to protect federal immigration agents as they picked up suspected violators.",

        "Only eight of the tournament's 32 teams are current domestic title holders, and three of the six continental champions are also missing",
      content:
        'For Gianni Infantino, it’s Christmas Eve. Back in 2016, not long after he was elected Sepp Blatter’s replacement as FIFA president, Infantino suggested the Club World Cup, hitherto a brief winter interlude consisting of a handful of matches played over less than two weeks, should be expanded on the basis that the old format was “not exactly inspiring”, and that his new setup would bring together “the best 32 clubs in the world”. Advertisement Now, almost a decade on, Infantino’s big idea — the thing he hopes will be his lasting legacy in the game — is finally here. The big jamboree kicks off in the United States on Saturday, but the problem is, when you take a closer look at the teams involved, you wonder whether Infantino’s promise that these are the best of the best will be fulfilled. Of the 32 participating sides, which represent 20 countries, only eight are their reigning domestic champions. The most recent title winners from England, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Argentina, Japan, Major League Soccer (the U.S. and Canada) and a few others are absent. That’s quite a lot of big/good teams missing. Of the six main continental club competitions from around the globe, only half of the reigning champions will be present. Paris Saint-Germain from Europe, Botafogo (South America) and semi-pro side Auckland City from Oceania are all there, but the most recent winners from Africa (Pyramids), Asia (Al Ahli) and North/Central America (Cruz Azul) will not. There is a logic to waving through the European, South American and Asian champions from the qualifying period (the continental winners each year from 2021 to 2024), but the problem is things move very fast in football. Rewarding a team in 2025 for what they did three or four years before isn’t necessarily going to produce great results. Take Urawa Red Diamonds. It’s harsh to say that anyone who wins a continental championship is lucky, but it was a big surprise when they won the 2022 Asian Champions League: they were drawn against teams from Malaysia and Thailand in the first two knockout rounds, then scrapped their way through the semi-final and final on penalties and 2-1 on aggregate respectively. They haven’t done much since. They last won Japan’s J-League in 2006 and their highest league finish since 2016 has been fourth. In the league’s most recent completed season, they finished 13th. Advertisement The same is true, to a lesser extent, with Chelsea. They’re here on the basis of winning the 2020-21 UEFA Champions League, but their league positions since then have been third, 12th, sixth and fourth. Which means they haven’t even played in the Champions League in the past two seasons. They are unrecognisable from the Chelsea that won Europe’s big one four years ago: the coach is different, the ownership is different and almost all the players are different from their starting line-up in that final (nine of the 11 have left the club permanently; a 10th, Ben Chilwell, was loaned out for the second half of this season after not making a league matchday squad for them in its first half). Other clubs are present thanks to a ranking system that takes in league and continental results over the past five seasons, but even that is flawed and gives undue prominence to achievements from three or four years ago. In 2021, Juventus had just won their ninth Serie A title in a row, but they’ve been in relative decline since and have only just managed three top-four finishes in the interim. Red Bull Salzburg have gone from perennial champions to relative also-rans in Austria. The last time the Seattle Sounders won the MLS title was 2019. Borussia Dortmund are the only team present who haven’t won a domestic or continental title in the qualifying period. Actually, that’s not quite true: the other team not to have done so are Inter Miami, who will play in the tournament’s opening match in their home city. We probably don’t need to outline what a farce, from a competitive/meritocratic point of view, their participation is. Congratulations to them for qualifying via the ‘Best Team To Employ Lionel Messi’ clause. Even looking past the qualifying criteria, it’s also worth noting that a lot of these clubs are going to be in various forms of turmoil. Advertisement Of the 32 clubs, 14 have changed head coaches in 2025, and six — Real Madrid, Inter, Al Hilal, Al Ahly, Pachuca and Monterrey — will have coaches whose first competitive game in charge will be the club’s opening match of this tournament. That’s not including Auckland City, whose manager Paul Posa will miss the start of their U.S. trip for personal reasons. In short, if you’re taking Infantino at his word and this tournament is going to be a brilliant spectacle of the best clubs that the game has to offer — the peak of the game in 2025 — then you might be quite disappointed. Perhaps this is all a little unfair on FIFA. If you’re going to have a tournament like this, then you probably do have to spread the qualifying criteria over a decent period of time. Perhaps you could contract it to two years, in order to have a better chance of getting teams who are actually good/playing well at the time of the tournament, but any shorter than that would be impractical. You couldn’t really, for example, wait to see who won continental or domestic titles in 2025, because it would only give those teams a few weeks’ notice of participation. Teams like Salzburg are there because each country is limited to two participants (except when they have won continental titles, hence four Brazilian teams being present), which is probably a good thing from a variety point of view but it means the organisers had to go quite a way down the list once all the third teams from various nations had been discounted. But the key phrase in that last paragraph is ‘if you’re going to have a tournament like this’. The more pertinent question is whether the whole concept is fundamentally flawed, whether you were ever going to get the best 32 teams in the world together and whether it should be taking place at all. It is a fairly Euro-centric view that the expanded format of this Club World Cup, to be played every four years, like the national-team version, is just a bit of a nuisance, that it’s a burden on an already overburdened global schedule. Advertisement The implications for the finances and profile of, say, some African clubs involved are significant and could be transformative for them. But the negatives outweigh the positives. For a start, on that financial argument, there is a real danger that the money earned by clubs like Mamelodi Sundowns and Al Ahly, already the richest clubs in South Africa and Egypt respectively, will simply serve to further solidify their dominance. From a broader, player-specific perspective, this is just more football that they don’t need. These are 32 sets of players who are arriving at this tournament either at the end of a long, hard season, or interrupting one to be there. They’re all tired. Plenty of them might be wondering why they have to play even more football when they should be resting. Players from Inter and Paris Saint-Germain, as well as Mamelodi Sundowns, will have benefited from a whopping two weeks of pause between their own Champions League finals and this event. The emotional exhaustion, as much as the physical, will be overpowering. You might say that players are already used to this sort of thing, with international tournaments for their countries. Which is true. But they at least have the historical significance of the World Cup, Copa America, Asian Cup or European Championship to provide a little more inspiration. Also, don’t overestimate the psychological difference between jumping on a plane with the same 25 guys you’ve spent the best part of a year living with, and going off to join an international setup where things are perhaps fresher, the faces less familiar, the atmospheres different. If a change is as good as a rest, it also works as a mental pep-up. Perhaps most importantly, national teams operate on cycles based around international tournaments, frequently the World Cup. They are designed to peak every four years. Clubs are not. At this time of year, clubs from Europe, Africa and parts of Asia have come to the end of their cycles — or seasons, as they are better known. June is the time when, if not quite by design but by necessity, clubs are in a state of flux, transition, chaos, call it what you will: they are not supposed to be in fighting shape at this time of year. Expanding and moving the Club World Cup was unnecessary from a sporting point of view, existing mostly to fulfil Infantino’s personal infatuation with ‘growing the game’, and to make money. But it’s here now. Just don’t expect it to be the top-class spectacle that he says it will be. (Top photo: Eva Marie Uzcategui/FIFA via Getty Images)',

        'North Korea successfully refloated a damaged naval destroyer, the Kang Kon, after a previous failed launch, with Kim Jong Un overseeing the event. Kim approved plans for two more destroyers, emphasizing the need to bolster naval power against perceived U.S. and allied threats.',
      content:
        "A North Korean naval destroyer damaged in a botched launch last month was successfully set afloat on a second attempt, with leader Kim Jong Un presiding, state media said Friday.A ceremony for the ship baptised the Kang Kon, after a top North Korean general killed in the 1950-53 war, was held on Thursday at the Rajin shipyard, up the coast from where the failed attempt occurred, according to Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency. Just over two weeks since the accident, the ship was safely raised and floated, and today, as planned, complete restoration has been finished, Kim said, according to KCNA.Kim has also approved a plan to build two more destroyer-class vessels next year, the agency added.The decision heralds a significant and dramatic change in the status and defence activities of (our) Navy, Kim said, according to KCNA.Photos released by the agency showed Kim, wearing a large straw hat and beaming happily, accompanied by his daughter Ju Ae, considered by many experts to be his likely successor.He claimed that the provocative intentions of the US and its allies have recently become more blatant, and the level of threats to our security has clearly gone far beyond the dangerous limit . We must develop our naval power more comprehensively and rapidly so that the enemy cannot even think of carrying out aggressive actions in the waters around us, the North Korean leader said.The successful launch comes after Pyongyang last month announced a serious accident when workers first tried to put the 5,000-ton destroyer into water in the northeastern port city of Chongjin. The mishap crushed sections of the bottom of the newly built ship. Pyongyang later covered it with a tarpaulin, satellite images showed.South Korean intelligence believe North Korea's so-called side-launch attempt of the ship failed, and the vessel was left listing in the water.Kim called the incident a criminal act caused by absolute carelessness and state media subsequently reported the arrest of four officials in connection with the botched launch.But the country said soon afterwards that the extent of damage to the vessel was not serious , and that it would take two or three days to drain it, and another 10 to restore the destroyer's side.The South Korean military estimated that, based on its size and scale, the new warship was similarly equipped to the 5,000-ton destroyer-class vessel Choe Hyon, which North Korea unveiled in late April. Seoul's unification ministry, which manages relations with Pyongyang, said no external structural defects have been identified on the destroyer .But continuous monitoring is required to determine whether it is functioning normally, the ministry said in a statement.Russian help?Pyongyang has said the Choe Hyon is equipped with the most powerful weapons, and that it would enter into operation early next year. Some analysts said the ship could be equipped with short-range tactical missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads -- although North Korea has not proven it has the ability to miniaturise its atomic arsenal. Seoul's military has said the Choe Hyon could have been developed with Russian help, possibly in exchange for Pyongyang deploying thousands of troops to help Moscow fight in Ukraine.North Korea confirmed in April for the first time that it had deployed troops to Russia to support Moscow in the Ukraine war. Hong Sung-pyo, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for Military Affairs, said it is almost certain that the North's latest warships are a result of Russia's assistance. North Korea is one of the very few countries that have supported Russia's war in Ukraine. Since it has provided very tangible assistance - including weapons and even personnel -- Russia will find it difficult not to reciprocate, he told AFP. What Pyongyang currently seeks the most are hard currency and advanced military technology. South Korea's new president, Lee Jae-myung, elected last week in a snap election, has promised a more dovish approach towards Pyongyang, compared with that of his hawkish impeached predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol.The Lee administration has halted loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts along the border, which Seoul began last year following a barrage of trash-filled balloons flown southward by Pyongyang.North Korea had resumed its own propaganda broadcasts, sending strange and eerie noises into the South, but it appears to have stopped.",

        'America seems headed to an angry and ugly place. Inflammatory incidents, rhetoric and dissent unleashed by President Donald Trump’s tough immigration crackdown are inexorably building political pressure as a polarized nation barrels into the heat of summer. Stunning scenes in Los Angeles on Thursday, when Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla was manhandled out of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s news conference and handcuffed, epitomized a dark turn taken this week in California. But there’s no sign yet of a path back from the brink before cascading confrontations and protests turn violent or even tragic. If anything, the crisis is deepening. The administration, led by a president determined to use every instrument of power — including a tamed Justice Department and the military — to enforce his will, is vowing to go harder, stronger and faster to target undocumented migrants. Even those here legally are not immune. The White House on Thursday told half a million Venezuelans, Haitians, Cubans and Nicaraguans here on humanitarian parole they must return to their unstable, poverty-stricken home countries. Trump’s extremism is now stirring a counter-reaction ahead of a weekend that will see hundreds of “No Kings” demonstrations in cities and towns , and after he warned against protests at a US Army 250th anniversary parade Saturday that will bolster his dictator’s schtick on his 79th birthday. A president who pledged to use the military on “the enemy from within” said this week he wants troops “everywhere.” The political battle is also finally being joined by Democrats , stung into finding a voice and cause after their so far desultory efforts to rebuild after their 2024 election fiasco. An image that will endure California was already on edge after Trump defied Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and ordered National Guard troops to the city amid protests and then added a contingent of active-duty US Marines. But the television pictures of government security agents restraining Padilla and pushing him to the ground on Thursday afternoon created an instantly iconic snapshot of the national moment. Some caveats should be noted. Any time a Cabinet official is in public, especially amid heightened political feeling, there is a concern for their safety. The horrific scenes after Trump survived his first assassination attempt last year remain a fresh national trauma. In the light of such experience, security details often act first and without waiting to establish the full context of a situation. It’s perfectly possible Noem’s agents didn’t immediately recognize Padilla, even though he’s one of the state’s senators. “I was there peacefully,” Padilla said later amid fierce dispute over his conduct. “At one point I had a question, and so I began to ask a question. I was almost immediately forcibly removed from the room. I was forced to the ground, and I was handcuffed. I was not arrested. I was not detained.” Initially, Noem seemed to realize the incident could become a political liability. She explained that the Secret Service had feared Padilla could be an attacker, so they pushed him away. She said his behavior was “not appropriate” but said they’d spoken afterward in what sounded like a civil conversation, even swapping phone numbers. But the Trump White House never admits fault and always seeks political vengeance. Noem toughened here message when she headed onto Fox News. “This man burst into a room, started advancing towards the podium ... he ... continued to lunge towards the podium,” she said. The Homeland Security secretary’s comments were quickly backed up by House Speaker Mike Johnson as the GOP launched a full court-press. “When they storm cabinet secretaries in a press conference, I think it’s wildly inappropriate behavior, and I think it sends a terrible message in tone for the rest of the country,” said a speaker who helped Trump expunge the record of the January 6, 2021, assault by MAGA supporters on the US Capitol. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who has this week accused Democrats of supporting criminals and rioters and demonized undocumented migrants as pedophiles, wrote on X that Padilla should be “ashamed of his childish behavior.” ‘He is not an animal’ In a less fraught time, Padilla might have acted with more discretion and the White House would have worked to mitigate the incident’s impact on America’s fragile psyche. But this is 2025, five months into Trump’s second term. Whatever precipitated the incident in Los Angeles, Padilla’s treatment — after he identified himself, when he was shoved out of the room as he tried to ask a question and then shoved face-first to the ground and handcuffed — was unheard-of. The racial overtones of California’s first Latino senator being put under such duress will become a metaphor for Trump’s ruthless deportation policy. “They use words like ‘lunge’ and ‘charge.’ He is not an animal; he’s a US senator,” California’s Attorney General Rob Bonta told CNN’s Kasie Hunt. In Washington, Democratic senators rushed to the chamber to exploit the moment. Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz warned that his colleague’s removal from Noem’s briefing was “the stuff of dictatorships.” Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, who has condemned Trump’s use of the military in California, warned in a statement: “This is America. Dissent should not be met with violence.” Across the Capitol, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Padilla suffered an “assault.” She added, “It’s a federal offense to attack a member of Congress. ... It shouldn’t be anybody in our country to be treated this way.” Padilla was the latest official to face harsh action for perceived dissent. Trump administration prosecutors have already indicted a Wisconsin judge and a New Jersey Democratic congresswoman in cases arising from the immigration blitz. But the fact his roughing-up was on camera means it could be a powerful political launching pad for Democrats as they step up resistance to the president. In the initial reaction to Padilla’s manhandling, there was just a hint that Democratic senators — part of an always self-reverential body — were most offended that the collective dignity of their august chamber had been affronted. But the quick and unified effort to frame the incident as an example of an encroaching Trump dictatorship suggests that the party might have found an opening at last. In some ways, the spectacle was not that different from the kind of on-camera stunt with viral social media potential that Trump has made a signature and that now dominates the populist Republican Party. A televised speech by Newsom this week finally satisfied the cravings of some Democrats for someone, anyone to take the fight to the president. His Senate colleague will never now be forgotten by Democrats after he introduced himself to the rest of the nation with the Thursday afternoon debacle that lit up cable news. But making a splash is only one of the Democrats’ problems. Padilla’s show of force does not necessarily point a way out of the conundrum Trump has set for them, namely that their public condemnations of his deportation plan allow the White House to portray them as soft on securing the border. Perhaps more evidence of administration thuggery could hurt Trump — and convince voters he is overreaching and inhumane. But the White House is still sure it’s got the winning political hand on immigration. Democrats are also no nearer to producing a coherent policy and electoral position that addresses the public’s desire to stem illegal immigration while reconciling liberal constituencies within their own political base. The Biden administration’s obliviousness to a long-building crisis and public sentiment has given Trump plenty of political cover. Does Trump have a moral duty to cool tensions? But Thursday’s drama poses an even more profound question: Do most Americans — notwithstanding their stark ideological divides — really want to live in a country plagued by ever-worsening conflict and disharmony? If not, Trump could be vulnerable and his iron-fist approach to immigration could end up serving as a microcosm of a destructive presidency. For sure, Trump’s base responds to his outlandish rhetoric and strongman vibe. But no one would describe the White House’s approach as a modulated effort to solve an immigration issue that has been haunting the nation for years. The crisis has confounded every president since at least Ronald Reagan. But while some commanders in chief have tried to solve it, Trump has been deliberately escalating the confrontation at every opportunity, seemingly to incite maximum discord and political stress. The president and his team argue with some justification that voters chose Trump last November because they were despairing over Biden’s negligence at the border. The White House insists that protests cannot be allowed to stop deportations that are needed to keep Americans safe and to deter new waves of migrants that could strain the country’s resources, unity and character. But they are also using the language of tyrants and demagogues as they seek to use the deportations to grab more and more power, to repress their political adversaries and even to threaten the choices of Democratic voters. During the news conference that was interrupted by Padilla, Noem warned that the federal government was not “going away” from Los Angeles. “We are staying here to liberate this city from the socialist and burdensome leadership that this Governor Newsom and this mayor placed on this country and what they have tried to insert into this city.” Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass are the democratically elected representatives chosen by Californians and the citizens of Los Angeles. Noem’s comments only reinforced an impression that Trump and his team view Democratic leaders as illegitimate and blue states as enemies within the US. Trump’s top domestic policy adviser Stephen Miller has spent the week portraying his boss’s political opponents as supporting invasions and rebellions by forces outside the United States. “America voted for mass deportations,” Miller wrote in one X post this week. “Violent insurrectionists, and the politicians who enable them, are trying to overthrow the results of the election.” The country needs no reminder that incitement and extreme political language can provoke violence and threaten the rule of law and the foundational democratic principles of the republic. It happened at the end of Trump’s first term. Historically, presidents have felt a moral imperative to cool political agitation when it threatens to splinter the nation and to heal such estrangements before they provoke strife and threaten life. Trump’s entire political method seems designed to do the opposite.',

        'A South Carolina Republican lawmaker — who once preached about the importance of safeguarding children from unnecessary harm — is accused of distributing more than 200 files of child pornography online while using the screen name “joebidennn69,” federal prosecutors alleged. Robert “RJ” May, 38, a member of the House of Representatives in the Palmetto State, was arrested at his Lexington County home Wednesday on a 10-count indictment charging him with distributing child sex abuse material, court documents showed. The married father of two used “joebidennnn69” and several other user names to exchange 220 obscene files containing extremely graphic footage of children and toddlers engaged in sex acts on the messaging app Kik over five days last spring, federal prosecutors alleged. The three-term rep allegedly downloaded the sickening files on his home Wi-Fi network and cellphone, prosecutors said, noting that some files were hidden using a private network while others were directly linked to his personal IP address. Lawyers for May suggested at his arraignment that someone else could have been using his WiFi password to procure and share the twisted images. Officials launched their investigation after the social app flagged suspicious activity to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in April 2024. Homeland Security agents searched May’s house in August 2024 and seized nearly three dozen electronic devices from his home, including a laptop, a tablet, four cell phones, four hard drives, and 19 thumbdrives, The State reported . On one of those seized devices, May allegedly kept several videos of himself on trips to Colombia engaging in sex with three women who appeared to be underage and were paid, a DHS official testified. Prosecutors asked that May not be given bail because his two children are the same age as those who were exploited in the illicit material. May, first elected in 2020, founded the House Freedom Caucus in the state as part of a hard-line conservative movement that ran to the right of many Republicans, according to The State. The House Freedom Caucus expelled May on Wednesday following his arrest with former allies now calling on him to resign from his position in the state house, that report stated. The congressman was a vocal advocate for pet conservative causes such as protecting the family. “We as legislators have an obligation to ensure that our children have no harm done to them,” May said in January 2024 during a debate on transgender care for minors, just months after his house was raided by feds. He was ordered to remain in jail until his trial. Each charge carries a five-to-20-year prison sentence. With Post wires',

Akazawa also said he was aware that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has signaled a possible extension of the July 9 deadline to return across-the-board tariffs to original rates, which would mean a bump to 24% from 10% for Japan.

The two are expected to meet on the sidelines of the Group of Seven leaders’ gathering starting Sunday. A 25% tariff on cars and car parts threatens to push the Japanese economy into a technical recession with a hit to the nation’s most important exports, just as Ishiba prepares for a national election in July.

        'Donald Trump’s deep state embrace has a message for Bharat: That it is alone in the global powerplay. But the good thing is that New Delhi has all the wherewithal to survive this storm',
      content:
        'When Donald Trump came to power for the second time in January this year, one expected him to take the fight to the “deep state” that many believed had hijacked the American administration. Trump, to his credit, made the right noises, especially during the election campaign when he pledged to supporters that voting him back into the presidency would help him “demolish the deep state”. Five months into the Trump presidency, many of his domestic supporters are disappointed already. As Ali Swenson writes in her Associated Press report , Trump, having long warned people of a government ‘deep state’, is under tremendous pressure to expose, if not dismantle, it. “His Justice Department has not yet arrested hordes of “deep state” actors as some of his supporters had hoped it would, even as the president has been posting cryptic videos and memes about Democratic politicians,” she writes. When the Americans voted for Trump this time, they expected a break in this Washington consensus where “the choice” was “between Coke or Pepsi, with the voters merely rubber-stamping one of the two preselected choices”, as author Mike Lofgren writes in his book, The Deep State: The Fall of the Constitution and the Rise of a Shadow Government . According to Lofgren, this “was the playbook as it had been rehearsed for many weary years”. He explains, “Republicans would stoke up the culture wars, fanning their touchily emotional base into an incandescent rage over Obama, the Kenyan Muslim socialist who had usurped the presidency, and Hillary, the bête noire of all true conservatives and Obama’s anointed successor. Democrats, for their part, would say, ‘Vote for us, because Rush Limbaugh!’ According to the playbook, economic issues like Wall Street regulation and trade were supposed to remain strictly between the forty-yard lines, while debates about foreign policy would tightly focus on the glory of killing bin Laden or the shame of Benghazi, not on whether we could ever hope to fix the Middle East with military force.” Trump, the outsider, threatened to disrupt this sinister consensus. He asked uncomfortable questions. He also pledged to expose the fixed match between the Republicans and the Democrats played under the prying eyes of the deep state. But today, Trump seems to have become a different man. Maybe he has always been like this—shifty, unpredictable, and unreliable. But this time, in five odd months, his transformation is complete, dismantling the idea of Trump as we knew him in the past decade or so. His friends have changed; so have his priorities. His most trusted ally, Elon Musk, has fallen out with him. And his National Security Adviser, Mike Waltz, has been shifted to the United Nations as its ambassador. Coming to Waltz, many believe he has paid the price for the ‘Signalgate’ scandal. But had this been the only reason, then Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth too should have faced the music for creating another Signal messaging chat that included his wife and brother, where he shared similar details of a March military airstrike against Yemen’s Houthi terrorists. Waltz would often call for closer ties between Bharat and the United States, while at the same time emphasising the threat that China poses to the world, especially in alliance with Pakistan. This Watzian worldview would have fitted well within the pre-January 20 Trumpian ecosystem, but today the Donald has pulled apart everything he seemed to believe before the inauguration of his second term. What Trump may not realise today, but someday he definitely will, is that with his U-turn he has not just squandered a geostrategic opportunity for the United States to realign the American priorities to the long-term US interests but also lost the goodwill of a sixth of humanity when not many were willing to give him a chance, especially outside the US. Disappointment with Trump within America will have political ramifications, but displeasure abroad will have geopolitical complications. Trump is today the antithesis of everything he epitomised five months ago. One can see the fundamental contradiction in his worldview from the fact that while he continues to fight Harvard, during his recent visit to West Asia, he hankered after Saudi-Qatari money, little realising (or maybe he doesn’t give a damn) that it is this petrodollar that has created the wokeist monster on American campuses. All through his campaign and before, Trump invoked the Islamist ghost, but when the time was ripe to put the jihadi djinn in the bottle during Operation Sindoor, launched by the Modi government to make Islamabad accountable for the gruesome Pahalgam killings, he fumbled. Rather, he took a conciliatory position, advising the leaders of Bharat and Pakistan to have a “nice dinner together”. He followed this up by crossing many other red lines, beginning with his pompous misinformation about brokering a ceasefire, even when Bharat has been unequivocal in reiterating the bilateral nature of the dispute. Just like his predecessors, Trump made the mistake of equating Bharat with Pakistan, calling the latter a “great nation”. Not very long ago, the Donald was on record wondering why the US funded a terrorist state like Pakistan. He would even call out Islamabad for hiding Osama bin Laden for six years and ask when it would apologise. As if that were not enough, Washington has invited Pakistan’s jihadi general, Field Marshal Asim Munir, to attend the US Army Day events. One of its top generals, Michael Kurilla, Commander of US Central Command (CENTCOM), has praised Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner” in counterterrorism. Trump’s astounding U-turn can also be seen in his administration’s recent decision to put an entry ban on travellers from 12 countries, including Afghanistan and Myanmar. Ironically, Pakistan has not just been missing from this list but also the one about countries that face “partial travel restrictions”. The exemption given to Pakistan—a country that has become synonymous with jihadi terrorism and would not long ago proudly claim to have fathered the Taliban to give itself a strategic depth—defies logic, except when one realises that Trump has embraced the deep state. This treacherous reality is also evident when one is told about the growing American presence and intervention in Bangladesh in the last few months. It has been a longstanding opinion of this author that America wants to engage with Bharat but only as a senior partner. It’s an unequal relationship that it seeks with Delhi. Bharat’s role in the West’s scheme of things is nothing more than that of a pawn—a strategic pawn, of course—needed to checkmate the Dragon. But the success of Operation Sindoor, where Bharat could do to a nuclear-armed nation what others could not even comprehend, and that too within a few hours of military exercise, has dazzled both its friends and rivals. America is suddenly alarmed: It believes it just cannot let a new rival (Bharat) rise in the battle to subdue the old one (China). This may explain Trump’s sudden outreach to China. This may also explain why Trump (even when we ignore his family’s dubious business interests in Islamabad) wants to give Pakistan a fresh leash of life. Will it work? Will the Trump-deep state design slow down, if not crumble, Bharat? The growing American belligerence may slow down Bharat’s growth and rise, but the fundamentals of the nation are strong. What America doesn’t realise is that not having Bharat by its side will lead to the decline of the US faster than it might slow Bharat’s rise. In all this, China (and Pakistan) can have a sigh of relief. When things were going awry for Emperor Xi, when the Chinese economy was set for massive decline, if not freefall, the Donald came up Nixon-like to give Beijing another shot at superpowerdom. Trump’s deep-state embrace has a message for Bharat: That it is alone in the global powerplay. Russia and Israel are the only reliable friends, but even they have compulsions: The Ukraine war has pushed Moscow closer to the Chinese fold, and such is Tel Aviv’s history and geography that it just cannot but overly rely on the Americans. The good thing is that Bharat has all the wherewithal to survive this storm. It needs to keep consolidating its economic gains by compensating for global trade/tariff challenges with its aatmanirbharta movement. With time, as Bharat continues to grow economically and geostrategically, the inner contradictions in the West-China-Pakistan alliance would emerge. There would be no stopping Bharat thereafter. The Americans, that day, would rue the missed Trumpian opportunity to not just keep Bharat by their side but also keep the US on the right side of history.

        "New York Governor's embarrassing confession about migrant who set sleeping woman on fire on subway By NOA HALFF FOR DAILYMAIL.COM and JON MICHAEL RAASCH, U.S. POLITICAL REPORTER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM Published: 04:29 BST, 13 June 2025 | Updated: 04:29 BST, 13 June 2025 e-mail View comments New York Governor Kathy Hochul was left speechless in a humiliating moment during a tense congressional hearing when she was asked to name the illegal immigrant accused of setting a sleeping woman on fire aboard a Brooklyn subway train. The Democrat was grilled by GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, who blasted Hochul over her handling of the migrant crisis before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Thursday. 'Do you know who Sebastian Zapeta-Calil is?' Stefanik asked during the House hearing. Zapeta-Calil, a Guatemalan illegal immigrant, was accused of torching an innocent woman to death on a Brooklyn train last December. But Hochul was caught off guard and appeared clueless, unable to recognize the name. 'I'm sure you'll tell me,' Hochul replied. 'There's many cases.' 'I don't have the specific details at my disposal, no.' 'These are high-profile cases. New Yorkers know about them and you don't?' Stefanik responded. Gov. Kathy Hochul was grilled by GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik (pictured) who blasted her over her handling of the migrant crisis before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Thursday in DC Hochul (pictured) was left speechless in a humiliating moment during a tense congressional hearing when she was asked to name the illegal immigrant accused of setting a sleeping woman on fire aboard a Brooklyn subway train Read More Deep blue state is swinging 'aggressively to the right' and there's polling to prove it 'Well this is an illegal migrant in New York because of your sanctuary state policies.' 'I bet you're gonna be familiar when I remind you, he found a sleeping woman on the subway, lit her on fire, and burned her alive. This is in Kathy Hochul's New York.' 'And as I'm sure you are aware, and I'll remind you that ICE issued an order to detain this violent criminal, but that was rejected by New York officials due to sanctuary state laws,' Stefanik continued. 'I just want to say this, these crimes are horrific,' Hochul replied. 'I condemn them.' 'Because of your sanctuary state policies,' Stefanik said. 'In all of these cases, we would work with ICE to remove them,' the governor replied. The embarrassing moment comes as Stefanik eyes a run against Hochul in 2026. Hochul appeared alongside Democrats Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at the hearing. She's positioning herself as the law-and-order candidate who protects New Yorkers from violent criminals. Hochul appeared alongside Democrats Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at the hearing. (Walz, Pritzker and Hochul are sworn in during a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing, Thursday, June 12) US Representative Jim Jordan, and US Elise Stefanik, listen during a Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing on 'A Hearing with Sanctuary State Governors' Zapeta-Calil, a Guatemalan illegal immigrant (pictured), was accused of torching an innocent woman to death on a Brooklyn train last December This comes as New York - one of America's most Democratic states - is experiencing a dramatic shift to the right for the first time in decades. A poll that was released last month found New York could be competitive for Republicans as candidates eye challenging unpopular Democratic Governor running for reelection. A GrayHouse poll found that just 36 percent approve of New York Governor Kathy Hochul's performance and 55 percent disapprove. The poll shows that rising Republican star Elise Stefanik, 40, is within striking distance of Hochul if she decides to run a campaign for governor. Forty-six percent of voters said they would vote for Hohul, while Stefanik would earn 40 percent of the vote. Fourteen percent of voters were undecided. After having her nomination for Ambassador to the U.N. scrubbed due to the House's tight GOP majority, Stefanik remains in the House. Deportation officers with Enforcement and Removal Operations in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's New York City field office arrest Wilmer Patricio Medina-Medina during an early morning operation, in the Bronx borough of New York, Dec. 17, 2024 House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries urged Stefanik to run on Thursday The harsh exchange was reminiscent of another congressional hearing that skyrocketed Stefanik into GOP legend. In 2023 the lawmaker issued scathing questionings of the then-presidents of Harvard University and University of Pennsylvania . The administrator's defense of antisemitic protests on campus in the wake of the October 7 attacks eventually led to both presidents being ousted, sealing a tangible GOP victory for Stefanik and Republicans over the Ivy League universities. This time, however, Stefanik could aim at her most likely opponent in a potential 2026 matchup. A Siena College poll from late May found that Stefanik and Hochul would likely win their respective primaries, Democrats still hold the very early edge in the general election. It's been 23 years since a Republican won a governor's race in New York. The top House Democrat, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, urged the congresswoman to run on Thursday. 'Here's my political advice for Elise Stefanik: Run, Elise, run,' baiting he Republican. GOP N.Y. Rep. Mike Lawler is also reportedly considering a run, though he, like Stefanik has not made any official announcements.

      content:
        'A Connecticut senator traveling in the Middle East this week is now stuck in Iraq after Israel launched an attack on Israel Thursday, heightening tensions in the area. Sen. Saud Anwar , co-chairman of the General Assembly’s public health committee and a medical doctor who serves as chair of the Department of Internal Medicine at Manchester Memorial and Rockville General Hospitals was the state’s first Muslim mayor and elected as senator from South Windsor. He has served on peace missions to Israel and the Middle East and done humanitarian work in the U.S. and abroad. Anwar, who is originally from Pakistan, said in a Facebook video that he after the June 4 legislative session end, he and his wife had traveled to the Middle East to learn more about the current situation and the history of the region. “After the session I came over here to learn more about this part of the world, learn about how many of the polices are impacting the lives of people here and also to learn about the lives that have been lost between the various things that have happened, the conflicts that have happened, and also visit the spiritual sites and history, as this has been the cradle of civilization,” he said. “We got a message that we have to leave Iraq yesterday from the U.S. Consulate so we changed our flights and changed our plans ... and we thought Najaf would be the best place to leave from but we have been informed that the entire airspace in Iraq has been closed down because of the Israeli attack on Iran. “We are safe we are OK. Just wanted to keep everybody posted,” he said. Assuring viewers that he was safe and sound, Anwar hoped for peace. “All is good on my end right now, just want the world to be a better place and people to calm down. There are people who are just trying to survive in all different parts of the world and wars don’t help in any shape or form.” Israel launched the attack on alleged nuclear sites around Tehran after the U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency censured Iran for the first time in 20 years for reportedly taking steps toward nuclear proliferation. U.S. President Donald Trump had warned of a potential attack and began moving troops in the region. “I don’t want to say imminent, but it looks like it’s something that could very well happen,” Trump said in response to a question from a reporter Thursday about a potential Israeli attack. “Look, it’s very simple, not complicated. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.” Tensions in the region are high following the attack, and Iran has promised to respond decisively. Israel has urged other nations to stand with it, claiming the country is aiming to eliminate a threat to Israel and the entire world. Australia and New Zealand have instead condemned the action. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said she was “alarmed by the escalation” between Israel and Iran, which she said risked further destabilizing an already volatile region. U.S. officials have also condemned the attack. U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the Israeli strike “a reckless escalation that risks igniting regional violence.” “These strikes threaten not only the lives of innocent civilians but the stability of the entire Middle East and the safety of American citizens and forces,” he said. Reed added: “I urge both nations to show immediate restraint, and I call on President Trump and our international partners to press for diplomatic de-escalation before this crisis spirals further out of control.” Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the attack was “clearly intended to scuttle the Trump Administration’s negotiations with Iran, risks a regional war that will likely be catastrophic for America and is further evidence of how little respect world powers – including our own allies – have for President Trump. “Iran would not be this close to possessing a nuclear weapon if Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu had not forced America out of the nuclear agreement with Iran that brought Europe, Russia, and China together behind the United States to successfully contain Iran’s nuclear ambitions,” Murphy said in a statement Thursday night. “This is a disaster of Trump and Netanyahu’s own making, and now the region risks spiraling toward a new, deadly conflict. A war between Israel and Iran may be good for Netanyahu’s domestic politics, but it will likely be disastrous for both the security of Israel, the United States, and the rest of the region. As Secretary Rubio stated, the United States was not involved in today’s strikes, and we have no obligation to follow Israel into a war we did not ask for and will make us less safe.” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Israel acted on its own and U.S. troops should not be targeted in retaliation. In a statement, he said: “Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region. Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense. President Trump and the Administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners. Let me be clear: Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.”',

        "[ Source ] Boston Mayor Michelle Wu is taking heat from federal officials after comparing masked ICE agents to “secret police” and suggesting similarities to a neo-Nazi group during immigration enforcement operations. Catch up The latest rebuke against Wu — who is running for re-election — erupted in late May after she told WBUR that people are “getting snatched off the street by secret police who are wearing masks and can offer no justification for why certain people are being taken and then detained.” Her comments came amid heightened immigration enforcement operations, including the March arrest of Turkish student Rumeysa Ozturk by masked, plain-clothed ICE agents in a Boston suburb. Federal officials defended the mask-wearing practice by highlighting safety concerns. ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons told reporters, “People are out there taking photos of the names, their faces and posting them online with death threats to their family and themselves.” Trending on NextShark: Manny Pacquiao fights back tears as he enters Boxing Hall of Fame Escalation of comments Last week, Wu drew parallels between ICE agents and NSC-131, a New England-based neo-Nazi group. “I don’t know of any police department that routinely wears masks,” she told reporters. “We know that there are other groups that routinely wear masks. NSC-131 routinely wears masks.” But when pressed on whether she was equating ICE with the organization, Wu declined to directly answer and instead reiterated that local police departments do not routinely wear masks. In response, the Department of Homeland Security called the comparison “sickening,” while White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson slammed her broader comments as “disgusting, dangerous attacks on law enforcement.” Trending on NextShark: Federal immigration raids in Los Angeles spark protests nationwide The big picture Wu’s confrontation with federal authorities builds on her March 5 congressional testimony before a Republican-led House Oversight Committee, where she defended Boston’s sanctuary policies by asserting that it is “the safest major city in the country.” The mayor shows no signs of retreating. Yesterday, she signed an executive order mandating regular Freedom of Information Act requests for ICE arrest details, saying “it is our responsibility to make sure that communication between our residents and the city of Boston in every manner is designed to boost trust and boost collaboration.” She also advised border czar Tom Homan to “take a time out” on ICE operations nationwide.

        'WASHINGTON, June 12 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will attend a National Security Council meeting on Friday morning, the White House said late on Thursday after Israeli strikes on Iran that have put the Middle East on edge. The meeting will be held at 11 am ET (1500 GMT) on Friday, the White House said. Sign up here. Israel said early on Friday Middle East time and late Thursday U.S. time that it had struck Iran to block Tehran from developing atomic weapons, and Iranian media and witnesses reported explosions including at the country\'s main uranium enrichment facility. U.S. top diplomat Marco Rubio called Israel\'s strikes against Iran a "unilateral action" and said Washington was not involved while also urging Tehran not to target U.S. interests or personnel in the region. The U.S. State Department said late on Thursday that the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem has directed all U.S. government employees and their family members to shelter in place until further notice. Trump had been seeking a new nuclear deal to place limits on Iran\'s disputed uranium enrichment activities but the talks have appeared to be deadlocked. Trump said earlier on Thursday an Israeli strike on Iran "could very well happen" but reiterated hopes for a peaceful resolution. The U.S. military is planning for the full range of contingencies in the Middle East, including the possibility that it might have to help evacuate American civilians, a U.S. official told Reuters. A security alert by the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem said the security environment was complex and could change quickly. In response to security incidents and without advance notice, the U.S. embassy may further restrict or prohibit U.S. government employees and their family members from traveling to certain areas of Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the State Department said.

        "[ Source ] Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang has reportedly reached out to Elon Musk with a proposal to collaborate on building a third political party following the billionaire’s fiery feud with President Donald Trump. Catch up Yang’s outreach follows Musk’s public breakup with Trump over federal spending legislation that would increase the deficit by $2.5 trillion. Musk, who worked with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) on spending cuts, opposed the legislation and polled his X followers about forming a new political party. The survey received 5.3 million votes, with 80.4% supporting the idea. Musk then suggested naming it the “America Party.” Yang, who leads the Forward Party — formed after his exit in the 2021 New York City mayoral Democratic primary — moved to connect with Musk following the poll, noting that Musk had endorsed his presidential bid as they both supported Universal Basic Income policies.

However, he has yet to hear back from the Tesla chief. Yang went on to stress that independents represent the U.S.’ fastest growing political movement, with voters feeling unrepresented by either major party. He emphasized common ground with Musk. “There are a number of things that I think Elon shares in common with a lot of other folks I talk to who want to see some kind of middle ground or balance,” he said. But his direct pitch to Musk was more pointed: “Elon, the political class will never get serious about putting America on a path to sustainability, and you’ve seen it up close. Help us build it.” Trending on NextShark: Federal immigration raids in Los Angeles spark protests nationwide Looking ahead Yang says the Forward Party has gained thousands of new followers in the last 24 hours since Musk’s poll appeared. He believes sufficient resources could produce thousands of locally elected officials within one cycle by targeting more than 500,000 local positions nationwide. He also envisions creating a fulcrum in the U.S. Senate through what he calls a “Legislator Liberation Fund” to buy out current legislators from their party contracts.

        'Good morning Nigeria. Welcome to the Naija News roundup of top newspaper headlines in Nigeria for today, Friday, 13th June, 20251. Tinubu Grants Ken Saro-Wiwa, Others National PardonPresident Bola Ahmed Tinubu has granted full pardon on Ken Saro Wiwa (CON), the leader of the Ogoni Nine and his fellow activists.Naija News reports that the President disclosed this on Thursday while addressing the National Assembly to mark the June 12 Democracy Day.He stated that he would grant the Ogoni nine activists and others whose names will be announced later in conjunction with the National Council of State.Recall that Ken Saro-Wiwa was tried by a special military tribunal for allegedly masterminding the murder of Ogoni chiefs at a pro-government meeting, and hanged in 1995 by the military dictatorship of General Sani Abacha.His execution provoked international outrage and resulted in Nigeria’s suspension from the Commonwealth of Nations for more than three years.2. I Defeated Obasanjo In The 1999 Election But Military Denied Me The Victory – Olu FalaeA former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chief Olu Falae, has claimed that he won the 1999 presidential election against former President Olusegun Obasanjo by 1.5 million votes, but was denied victory by the military.Falae submitted that the military manipulated the result to favour Obasanjo because they feared that he would probe their regime if he emerged as the President of Nigeria.Naija News reports that Chief Falae made the claim on Thursday during an interview with Arise News to mark the 2025 June 12 Democracy Day.According to him, his lawyer was also able to establish in court that the votes from the 1999 presidential election were duplicated to favour Obasanjo and edge him out of the race.Speaking further, Falae said he could not have been stupid enough to probe a government he was a part of, as feared by the military authorities.3. June 12: Tinubu Fails To Reinstate Fubara As Rivers State Governor, End Emergency RulePresident Bola Ahmed Tinubu has failed to announce the reinstatement of Governor Siminalayi Fubara as the Governor of Rivers StateNaija News reports that many had called on the president to use the occasion of his Democracy Day speech to announce Fubara’s reinstatement.While he granted pardon to Ken Saro-Wiwa alongside others and conferred national honours on distinguished Nigerians, President Tinubu failed to reverse the State of Emergency in Rivers State.Tinubu had, on March 18, declared a state of emergency in Rivers State and announced a six-month suspension of Fubara from office. Also suspended was Rivers State Deputy Governor, Ngozi Odu and the State House of Assembly.Reports had emerged claiming that former President, Goodluck Jonathan, was reportedly leading behind-the-scenes efforts to secure the reinstatement of Fubara before the upcoming June 12 Democracy Day celebration.According to sources who spoke with Vanguard, Jonathan held at least one private telephone conversation with President Bola Tinubu, appealing for Fubara’s reinstatement in the spirit of national reconciliation and democratic principles.4. ‘It Is Indeed A Pleasure To Witness You In Disarray’ – Tinubu Mocks Opposition PartiesPresident Bola Ahmed Tinubu took a swipe at Nigeria’s major opposition parties on Thursday, declaring it a “pleasure” to watch the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Labour Party (LP) fall apart due to internal conflicts.Naija News reports that Tinubu made the comments during a joint session of the National Assembly as part of activities marking this year’s Democracy Day celebration.Addressing lawmakers and dignitaries gathered at the National Assembly complex in Abuja, Tinubu welcomed new members from opposition parties into the All Progressives Congress (APC), stating that the ruling party remains open to all.Tinubu said, triggering applause from APC lawmakers, “You are all welcome to the progressive fold. Nobody should close the door.”“It is indeed a pleasure to witness you in such a disarray,” he added, in a jab at the opposition’s current disunity.The president did not hold back in mocking the panic within opposition circles over a wave of defections and internal grievances.5. Abacha Did Not Steal Money, He Kept It In National Account To Support Nigeria – Al MustaphaHamza Al-Mustapha, former Chief Security Officer to late military Head of State, General Sani Abacha, has dismissed allegations that his former boss stole Nigeria’s money and hid it in foreign countries.Speaking during an interview with the BBC, he alleged that the money in question was used to support Nigerians during tough economic times.He insisted that the money was not stolen but kept in a national account to support Nigeria’s economic plan.He explained that after studying Libya’s system, the Abacha government introduced a policy that allowed Nigerian-owned companies to receive government support to buy goods and sell them to citizens at affordable prices.6. NASS Okays June 12 As Presidential Day Of AddressThe National Assembly has confirmed June 12 as the day for the President of Nigeria to address a joint session of the lawmakers.The resolution was adopted on Thursday, June 12, 2025, during a special Democracy Day sitting at the National Assembly Complex in Abuja, where President Bola Tinubu delivered a commemorative address to lawmakers.The date was adopted during the joint session presided over by Senate President Godswill Akpabio following a motion raised by Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tajudeen Abbas.The adoption and announcement follow a voice vote on the matter by the lawmakers.7. ‘The Economy Don Show Me Shege, I Dey Hustle Night And Day’ – Tiwa SavageNigerian Afrobeat singer, Tiwa Savage, has lamented about the financial pressures she faces as a single mother amid the country’s economic situation.Naija News reports that the female sensational singer, in a post via Instagram story, addressed those constantly seeking financial help from her.The award-winning singer stated that she is also facing challenges due to the current economic situation in Nigeria, adding that she works tirelessly day and night to stay afloat.She wrote, “Because even me sef the economy don show me shege. I am a single mother abeg, I dey hustle night and day. May God bless us all”.8. ‘Shame On Everyone Involved In Making This Happen’ – Buchi Solomon Reacts As Glorilla Wins Best Gospel ArtisteNigerian social commentator, Solomon Buchi, has condemned organisers of the British Entertainment Television (BET) awards for awarding best gospel artiste to American rapper and songwriter, Glorilla.Naija News reports that the BET awards ceremony held last weekend, and Glorilla took home the award for best gospel artiste.In a video shared online, Buchi argued that Glorilla’s music collaboration with a gospel artist does not mean she is a gospel singer and therefore does not deserve the award.According to him, Glorilla, who dresses seductively and opens sensitive parts of her body, does not deserve to win the award.Buchi Solomon added that the gospel became a scam since it stopped being a ministry.9. NPFL Frowns At Unauthorised Use Of League Name In Golden Boot AwardThe Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) has expressed strong disapproval over the unauthorised use of its name by certain corporate organisations and individuals in the organisation of football awards.This concern was raised by NPFL Chairman, Gbenga Elegbeleye, following the recent announcement of the Eunisell Golden Boot Award, slated to honour the top scorer of the 2024-2025 NPFL season, Anas Yusuf, with a cash prize of ₦3.6 million.While acknowledging the value such initiatives bring to the league and its players, Elegbeleye insisted that there are formal procedures to be followed by any organisation seeking to partner with the NPFL or use its brand identity.The award ceremony is scheduled to take place on Friday, June 13, 2025, at the Radisson Blu Hotel, GRA Ikeja, Lagos.Elegbeleye, however, maintained that the NPFL will not tolerate what he described as “an ambush” of the league’s intellectual property and commercial rights.10. Matheus Cunha, Trent Alexander-Arnold Seal Dream Transfers To European GiantsTwo of football’s brightest stars have realized lifelong dreams with major moves to European giants, as Brazil’s Matheus Cunha joins Manchester United while Real Madrid unveiled England’s Trent Alexander-Arnold.Manchester United have confirmed the signing of Brazilian forward Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers in a deal worth £62.5 million.The Red Devils triggered the release clause in Cunha’s contract earlier this month, and the transfer has now been finalized following a successful medical and visa approval.Real Madrid unveiled England right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold earlier on Thursday after completing a sensational switch from Liverpool.The 26-year-old was set to leave on a free transfer at the end of June but the Spanish club paid a fee to secure his release early, allowing him to feature in the upcoming Club World Cup.That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.

        'The quirky film, about a women who dies and whose spirit returns by possessing a vacuum cleaner, explores power and political oppression in Thailand',
      content:
        'When Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke became the first Thai director to win the Critics Week’s Grand Prize in May, he paid an unusual tribute. “I would like to dedicate this award to all the ghosts in Thailand,” he told the audience. Ratchapoom’s film, A Useful Ghost, tells the story of a man whose wife dies after falling ill from dust pollution, and whose spirit returns by possessing a vacuum cleaner. It is a quirky story full of symbolism and dark humour that explores power and political oppression in Thailand. “ One of the main intentions for the film would be [to talk about] how we deal with injustice in the past,” says Ratchapoom. “There’s so many people who suffered, who got punished, who disappeared,” he adds, referring to Thailand’s turbulent political history, marked by military coups, protests and deadly crackdowns. A Useful Ghost’s success comes at a time of increased optimism about Thailand’s film industry. Domestic productions are increasingly driving box office sales, claiming a greater share of ticket sales than Hollywood movies, and achieving success abroad. This includes the 2024 release of How To Make Millions Before Grandma Dies , which broke records for Thai film in neighbouring countries, and became the first Thai film shortlisted for the international feature film at the Oscars. The Thai government, keen to foster the country’s film sector, has launched a $6.4 million film fund to support productions. Censorship rules are also being relaxed - though content that may affect the monarchy remains prohibited. The powerful royal family is shielded from criticism by a strict l ese majesty law , which carries a jail sentence of up to 15 years. Related: Golden age for south-east Asian cinema as local films break box office records Ratchapoom says he is unsure what kind of reaction his film will generate when it premiers in Thailand. “I think it will cause some discussion,” he said. The film touches on history some would prefer to forget but which, over recent years, younger people have grown increasingly keen to uncover. “Trying to unearth what is censored or suppressed is one way to fight the authoritarian,” said Ratchapoom. “History is one of the battlefields.” Ratchapoom, 38, grew up in a Thai Chinese family in Bangkok, in a household full of film. His father, who had a small business, was obsessed with watching movies, mostly from the US and Hong Kong. Ratchapoom would pour over his dad’s film magazines in his spare time, and seek out international releases at pirate DVD shops in Bangkok’s Chatuchak market. He went on to study film at Chulalongkorn University, in Bangkok, and worked as a TV script writer before gaining international recognition with his short film Red Aninsri; Or, Tiptoeing on the Still Trembling Berlin Wall, about a transgender sex worker who goes undercover as a spy, which won the Junior Jury award at Locarno film festival in 2020. Ratchapoom began writing A Useful Ghost in 2017, three years after the military seized power in a coup , arresting its critics, and pressuring news outlets into self-censorship. The film’s obsession with memory and mind control is inspired by a creeping trend that emerged under the junta: the destruction of monuments commemorating the 1932 revolution, when the absolute monarchy was overthrown and democracy introduced to Thailand. One plaque, which had laid on the ground in Bangkok for decades, was replaced in 2017 with a new monument that read: “To love and respect the Buddhist trinity, one’s own state, one’s own family, and to have a heart faithful to your monarch, will bring prosperity to the country”. In A Useful Ghost the destruction of monuments creates dust, a reference to Thailand’s continued air pollution crisis. But dust is also a symbol for “powerless people who are voiceless”, said Ratchapoom. Thai filmmakers have a long history of using metaphors and symbolism to allude to sensitive political topics. It wasn’t until the pandemic that Ratchapoom was able to put together the first draft of the screenplay. By then, youth-led pro-democracy protests had filled the streets, demanding the removal of the former junta leader, and then prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha , and breaking a major taboo to make an unprecedented call for reforms of the country’s powerful monarchy. Protest leaders proclaimed that the “ceiling had been lifted”; the unspeakable was now being said. Related: Thailand protesters ‘cross the Rubicon’ and risk all to criticise the monarchy At the time, Ratchapoom wondered if his own film would appear old-fashioned, given how outspoken younger generations had become. Ironically, in the past few years, such expansions of freedom of expression have been reversed, he said, adding: “Suddenly, it’s not so obsolete. The ceiling has been lowered again.” Many protest leaders are in prison, facing charges or in exile. Thailand is no longer ruled by former military generals, following elections in 2023 , but Ratchapoom does not feel hopeful about Thailand’s politics. Under the junta, there was at least a sense that “there’s every reason to fight, to resist”, he said. Such momentum has dissipated. He does, however, feel more hopeful about the state of Thailand’s film industry. “I believe that in the next few years there will be more exciting projects, films or series coming off Thailand,” he said. The film’s premier in Thailand and elsewhere is yet to be confirmed. Ratchapoom hopes it will open fresh debate. “I hope these things that I talk about - the silenced and suppressed past, the injustice in the past – could be brought up or unearthed and people will start like talking about it again.”',

        'Seven Democratic candidates vying to become New York City’s next mayor clashed on Thursday night in the second and final debate before the June primary. The two-hour debate quickly turned combative with the frontrunners, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and democratic socialist assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, sparring over their records and qualifications. Cuomo, 67, who is attempting a political comeback after resigning from his role as governor in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations , dismissed 33-year-old Mamdani as unprepared and too inexperienced for the role of New York City mayor. “I think inexperience is dangerous,” Cuomo said, before running through a list of political institutions that he claimed Mamdani had never dealt with. “He’s never built anything,” Cuomo continued. “He’s never dealt with a natural emergency. He’s never dealt with a hurricane, with a flood, etc. He’s never done any of the essentials. And now you have Donald Trump on top of all of that.” Mamdani fired back: “To Mr Cuomo, I have never had to resign in disgrace, I have never cut Medicaid, I have never stolen hundreds of millions of dollars from the MTA, I have never hounded the 13 women who credibly accused me of sexual harassment, I have never sued for their gynecological records, and I have never done those things because I am not you, Mr Cuomo.” Mamdani also criticized Cuomo for repeatedly mispronouncing his name: “The name is Mamdani. You should learn how to say it.” Cuomo continued his attacks, calling Mamdani “a man who has done nothing”. Mamdani defended his record as an assemblymember, citing work and organizing he did to help New York City taxi drivers. Mamdani, who said it was “time for a new generation of leadership”, urged New Yorkers to judge him by the campaign he’s running, where he manages 36,000 volunteers. He promised to bring “innovation and competence” to city hall and hire “the best and the brightest”. In addition to Cuomo and Mamdani, five other candidates were on the stage: the city comptroller, Brad Lander; the council speaker, Adrienne Adams; the state senator Zellnor Myrie; the former comptroller Scott Stringer; and the former hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson. The debate opened with moderators asking the candidates about the Trump administration’s immigration raids in Los Angeles and the administration’s response to the protests against the immigration crackdown. “If you were mayor of New York right now, how would you handle this situation, if something like that happened here?” the moderators asked. “We are going to protect our immigrants,” Cuomo said. “This is a sanctuary city, and we are going to defend the laws of the sanctuary city.” “Donald Trump only picks fights that he can win. He cannot win a fight with me as mayor of New York,” Cuomo added. Mamdani pledged to block any New York City police department cooperation with federal immigration agents if elected, and vowed to provide and fund legal support for immigrants facing deportation cases. Other candidates, such as Adrienne Adams, said they would sue the federal government. Cuomo faced sustained criticism throughout the night. Lander, the city comptroller, repeatedly challenged Cuomo’s record. Early in the debate, Lander pressed Cuomo on his use of the term “illegal immigrants”, prompting Cuomo to switch to “undocumented”. Throughout the debate, Lander accused Cuomo of failing to take accountability for things that had occurred while he was governor. “I lead by building the best teams, not through sexual harassment, corruption and disgrace,” Lander said. Cuomo was asked about the sexual harassment allegations against him that led to his 2021 resignation. Cuomo called them “political” and urged voters to “look at the facts”. Lander responded by saying that if Cuomo were elected mayor, he would not tell college students to work in city government, and that he would have to tell them: “Don’t go work at city hall because the mayor is a sexual harasser.” Cuomo hit back, saying that Lander was telling lies. On housing, all of the candidates said that they would want to build more housing in New York City. Cuomo and Tilson were the only candidates on the stage who did not support a rent freeze for rent-stabilized units for this year. On public safety, Myrie said the issue called for subway teams made up of both police and mental health experts, and said that he would institute 50,000 more summer youth jobs and after-school programs. Tilson attacked Mamdani, arguing that he had “demonized” the police. In response, Mamdani said that if elected he would “not defund the police” and said that he would “work with the police because I believe the police have a critical role to play in creating public safety”. He also called for mental health and social workers to help the police respond to emergency calls. Moderators pressed Cuomo on why, during “10-plus years as governor”, he had not made a “public visit to a mosque” and asked him what he would say “to more than 760,000 Muslims here in the city about whether or not you would reach out to them, make them feel welcome, make them feel protected?” In response, Cuomo said that he believed he had visited a mosque and added: “I would say, we are a city of immigrants, I welcome them, I love them.” Mamdani was also asked to address concerns from Jewish New Yorkers supportive of Israel who “fear for their safety in this current political climate”. Mamdani responded: “I hear them and that I have heard them over the course of this campaign and before that”, adding: “I will protect Jewish New Yorkers and deliver them that safety.” Mamdani received criticism from Cuomo and Tilson over his criticisms of Israel. Tensions also escalated when Mamdani, who is Muslim, accused Cuomo’s Super Pac of altering a photo on a leaked draft campaign flyer to make his beard look darker, longer and thicker. Mamdani first made the accusation earlier on Thursday on Instagram , calling it “blatant Islamophobia”. Unlike the previous week’s debate, which was held without an audience, Thursday’s event had a live crowd that reacted audibly throughout with clapping, cheering, booing and laughter. The final debate on Thursday came after several major recent endorsements. The New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez threw her support behind Mamdani after last week’s debate, while the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed Cuomo this week. New polling released this week underscores just how tight the race has become. The Democratic primary election will be held on 24 June, with early voting beginning 10 days earlier, on 14 June. The election will use ranked-choice voting , allowing New Yorkers to rank up to five candidates in order of preference. The current New York mayor, Eric Adams, who ran as a Democrat in 2021, is seeking re-election as an independent candidate. The general mayoral election is set for 4 November.',

        "BREAKING NEWS Taylor Swift sits with Donald Trump ally Wayne Gretzky at Stanley Cup Final READ MORE: Swift and Kelce coverage at Stanley Cup Final infuriates NHL fans By OLIVER SALT Published: 03:32, 13 June 2025 | Updated: 03:48, 13 June 2025 e-mail View comments Taylor Swift was pictured sitting alongside Donald Trump supporter Wayne Gretzky at the Stanley Cup Finals in Florida - despite her long-running feud with the president. The pop icon and her boyfriend Travis Kelce made a shock appearance at Thursday night's Game 4 showdown between the Florida Panthers and Edmonton Oilers. And during the third period, Swift sparked controversy after she was seen watching the final unfold next to both Kelce and hockey legend Gretzky, whose friendship with Trump is well-documented. Just under a month ago, the latter took a random shot at Taylor when he claimed on Truth Social that he is the reason she is 'no longer hot.' Liberals and Swift's legion of diehard fans were therefore not happy to see her in the company of a full-blown Trump ally on Thursday night. 'Ugh with a trumpster so disappointed,' one Swiftie wrote on X. Taylor Swift was pictured sitting with Trump ally Wayne Gretzky at the Stanley Cup Finals Swift sparked controversy after she was seen watching the final unfold next to both her boyfriend Travis Kelce and Gretzky The hockey icon has come under fire in his home country of Canada for being close with Trump Read More EXCLUSIVE REVEALED: One in five Canadians believe Wayne Gretzky should make drastic move over Trump friendship Another posted: 'it’s unfortunate he’s a huge maga trumpie'. 'Would be great if taylor swift could stop associating with trump supporters actually,' said a third. 'Noo taylor get out of there,' a fourth warned. While one simply put along with a Canadian flag: 'Boooooooo'. Some of Swift's most loyal supporters were even unsure if the picture of their idol sitting with Gretzky was actually real. One asked: 'is this ai?' Another user, meanwhile, pointed out that Gretzky may well be in his friend's bad books after sitting next to Swift. 'Trump Will not be happy to see his friend Gretzky with Taylor Swift,' they concluded. Gretzky has come under fire both in his homeland of Canada and its contentious neighbor of the United States in recent months over his friendship with the American president . Despite threatening to make Canada the 51st US state, and his government placing tariffs on imports from the country, Trump still has the backing of the four-time Stanley Cup winner, whom he has tipped to run for 'governor' one day. Swift looked in fine spirits as her and Kelce enjoyed a conversation with Gretzky in Florida Less than a month ago Trump took this random shot at the pop megastar on Truth Social A mid the controversy surrounding his political affiliations, Gretzky recently joined Swift's boyfriend Kelce and his brother Jason on the latest episode of their New Heights podcast. The pair were thrilled to have him on the show, with an impassioned Jason reeling off some of his greatest achievements before introducing him as 'the great one'. However, a number of fans hit out at the Kelce brothers for hosting a Trump supporter as a special guest on their podcast - especially following the latter's recent attack on Swift. One user commented on a teaser clip of the Gretzky episode: 'MAGA- really??? Do better!' 'This would have been a lot more interesting before he went public as a MAGA loser,' said another. 'So Trump went after Taylor and your answer is to invite a big trumpie guy who is friend with him ?!? Have some shame,' fumed a third. A fourth put: 'Love you Kelce brothers but do better. Having maga gretzky on sucks! Wonder what Taylor thinks.....' While one simply commented: 'No thanks.' Trump recently sparked outrage after unleashing the random attack on Swift earlier this month. Swift and Kelce made a shock appearance at the game between the Panthers and the Oilers The 78-year-old hit out at Kelce's pop star lover in a bizarre Truth Social post while traveling back to the US from Saudi Arabia, claiming he is the reason she is 'no longer hot.' 'Has anyone noticed that, since I said \"I hate Taylor Swift ,\" she's no longer \"HOT?\"' he wrote on the social media platform. Trump has taken plenty of shots at Swift over the years, particularly after her endorsement of Joe Biden in the 2020 election . Yet Kelce was said to be absolutely furious after his latest dig at his girlfriend, which marked an unprompted escalation in his attacks. A source told DailyMail.com that the Kansas City Chiefs legend wants to use it as motivation at this summer's NFL training camp rather than respond publicly and 'open another can of worms.' 'Travis is livid that the President of the United States is talking negatively about Taylor,' our insider said. 'He is so mad that he is going to use it as motivation during training for the season ahead, especially if Trump continues talking. 'Since Travis can't say anything publicly because that would just open another can of worms, he has to figure out ways to get it out of his system because he would love to protect Taylor and stick up for her. 'But keeping quiet is the move he has to do right now.'

        'Welcome to Declassified, a weekly humor column.Once upon a time in Mar-a-Lago, Elon Musk and Donald Trump were political soulmates — a bromance forged in tweets, Tesla stocks, and errant Truths. But alas, the relationship has frayed. And to Europeans, the slap-fight plays like a particularly chaotic Eurovision act: loud, overproduced, and somehow involving a rocket.Last week, the U.S. president and his billionaire ex-first buddy have been backpedaling on their relationship with the elegance of a self-driving Cybertruck in a school zone.It all started with an awkward Oval Office sendoff for a randomly black-eyed Elon. Trump presented Musk with a toy golden key, which was a special honor that he gives to (some) very special people; Musk deserved it since he “gave such an incredible service, nobody liked him!”Things escalated from there, with the two billionaires throwing tantrums on the social media platforms that they each own — as real grown-ups do.Once freed of his DOGE duties, Elon decided to let the world know how he really felt about his bro, calling Trump’s big, beautiful bill a “disgusting abomination.” The Donald responded in kind, going in a heartbeat from “incredible service” to “he went CRAZY!” Musk dropped the real bombshell, though, when he posted on X: “Trump is in the Epstein files.” You can always count on privileged, rich white men to keep it classy.Finally, surrealism reached new heights when the voice of reason turned out to be none other than Kanye “I just told you who I thought I was, a god” West, who tried to patch things up between the two former friends by posting on X: “Brooos please nooo” with a hug emoji. Surprisingly, that did not work.Across the pond, European diplomats sip espresso and watch in fascinated disbelief as the world’s richest troll trades blows with America’s oft-impeached president. Brussels bureaucrats who’ve spent years methodically drafting complicated, technical legislation now huddle around phones like it’s a football World Cup penalty shoot-out.The consensus? It’s entertaining, it’s terrifying, it’s peak America — part gladiator match, part group therapy session for men who think X is foreign policy.And what if, after all this, Donny and Elon reunite?Expect a press release written in all caps, peppered with emojis, hosted on X, livestreamed via Neuralink, and featuring a limited-edition flamethrower giveaway.CAPTION COMPETITION“When you hit the ball and instantly regret all your life choices.”Can you do better?

Here’s the best one from our mailbag — there’s no prize except the gift of laughter, which I think we can all agree is far preferable to cash or booze.“You don’t know this, but I want to lose my election.”by Roman Boyer',

        'A congressional hearing quickly devolved into a shouting match between two Republicans and a Democrat who sought a subpoena for Kristi Noem over the forcible removal of Senator Alex Padilla from a Thursday press conference. During a Thursday hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL) implored his fellow lawmakers to subpoena Noem over the incident, which saw her security team manhandle and handcuff the Democratic senator after he loudly questioned the Homeland Security Secretary about ICE raids that have led to nationwide protests. Rep. James Comer (R-KY), the committee chairman, quickly waved off Frost’s concerns over the incident. “Mr. Chair, also, we were just talking about this. I want to know if you can commit to working with us so we can subpoena,” Frost began to say, before Comer cut him off. “You’re out of order,” Comer replied. The two congressmen briefly spoke over each other until Comer recognized MAGA firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who entered the tense scene guns blazing. “Oh, Democrats can’t follow the rules, can’t follow the law,” she said twice. “We need to subpoena Kristi Noem,” Frost repeated. “It’s her staff, DHS federal officers, that threw a U.S. senator to the ground.” Greene continued to talk over the young Democrat: “There’s a privilege of the majority, and that means we’re in charge. Not your side because you lost the election because you supported the invasion of our country.” Frost, Greene, and Comer all refused to back down until the chairman grew exasperated with the back-and-forth. “Shut up. Just shut up,” Comer told Frost, who had repeatedly asked him to commit to subpoenaing Noem. “No, you’re not gonna tell me to shut up,” Frost hit back. “He’s been out of order six times,” Comer said of Frost. “He is trying to get on MSNBC. You probably knocked somebody off MSNBC to get on there.” The chairman then handed the floor over to Greene, who lobbed a bizarre accusation at Frost without providing evidence. “I think because he’s been arrested as a former Antifa member, right?” she said of Padilla, referring to the far-left movement. “He’s a former Antifa member... Not surprised.” Frost appeared to be in disbelief as he asked for Greene’s remarks to be taken off the record. The dramatic interaction ended when Greene turned her attention to New York Governor Kathy Hochul to ask questions. Several Democrats have rallied around Padilla following his wild takedown. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for an immediate probe into the “un-American” incident: “To look at this video and see what happened reeks—reeks—of totalitarianism," he said. “This is not what democracies do.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries echoed Schumer in a post, stating that those behind “the brazen and aggressive manhandling of Senator Padilla” must be “held accountable.” Noem called Padilla’s interruption “inappropriate,” while Homeland Security official Tricia McLaughlin slammed the senator for choosing “disrespectful political theater.” Noem and Padilla spoke for 15 minutes after the incident, McLaughlin said.',

        'Frontrunners Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani got into a number of heated spats over the importance of age, experience and personal integrity during Thursday night’s second and final Democratic mayoral primary debate, highlighting a set of issues that have emerged as key focuses in the final sprint of the 2025 campaign.The debate, held just two days before early primary voting gets underway Saturday, featured the seven leading Democratic candidates in the race and covered a range of topics, including everything from immigration and housing to public safety, sanitation and fighting back against President Trump’s agenda.Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo speaks during the New York City Democratic Mayoral Primary Debate at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in the Gerald W. Lynch Theater on June 12, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by VINCENT ALBAN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)One of the most heated moments of the night came as the moderators quizzed Cuomo and Mamdani — who have consistently polled as the front-runner candidates — on whether it’s important to have extensive government experience.At 67, Cuomo would become the oldest mayor to take office in the modern era, and the ex-governor sought to characterize that as a positive, citing his decades of experience working as governor, state attorney general and federal housing secretary.By contrast, Mamdani, a democratic socialist Queens Assembly member, would at 33 become one of the youngest mayors in the modern era, and Cuomo said it’d be “dangerous” and “reckless” to put him in charge at a time of myriad challenges, including Trump’s efforts to strip significant federal funding from the city.“He’s accomplished nothing,” Cuomo said of Mamdani, whose sole elected job has been serving in the Assembly since 2021, calling his resume “laughable.”Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani speaks during the New York City Democratic Mayoral Primary Debate at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in the Gerald W. Lynch Theater on June 12, 2025 in New York City.

Lynch Theater at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan.The other candidates piled on, with Brad Lander saying Cuomo has the wrong type of experience, arguing the city needs steady leadership not a record of “sexual harassment, corruption and disgrace.”“Those are bald faced lies,” Cuomo protested, turning directly to Lander, who has generally polled as the No. 3 candidate in the race. Cuomo has denied ever sexually harassing anyone, but has apologized to anyone he said he made feel uncomfortable.Also on stage for the final debate were Adrienne Adams, Zellnor Myrie, Scott Stringer and Whitney Tilson.Besides age, Cuomo and Tilson, who offered a surprise cross endorsement of the ex-gov during the debate, went after Mamdani on policing, noting he had called for defunding the NYPD during the COVID pandemic.“I will not defund the police,” Mamdani replied, adding that police officers should focus on major crimes, not jobs more fit for social workers. “I will work with the police because I believe the police have a critical role to play.”Speaker Adams, whose campaign has gained some momentum lately, accused Cuomo of mischaracterizing the COVID-era defund the police movement, arguing it was about reallocating resources in a smarter way, not slashing funding. “I don’t know how long we’ve been out of it, Mr. Cuomo ... Slogans and scare tactics aren’t going to make anybody in New York safer,” she said.City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams speaks during the New York City Democratic Mayoral Primary Debate at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in the Gerald W.

Tilson, who focused a significant chunk of his comments on attacking Mamdani, argued that Mamdani’s use of the word “genocide” in describing Israel’s war in Gaza means he is in part responsible for a recent uptick in antisemitic incidents in New York.“I am being smeared,” Mamdani replied, arguing Israeli historians and former prime ministers have used similar language to describe the war.Former hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson speaks during the New York City Democratic Mayoral Primary Debate at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in the Gerald W. Lynch Theater on June 12, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by VINCENT ALBAN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)The issues of age and experience have emerged as key focuses in the home stretch of the race, especially for Cuomo, whose campaign and super PAC has recently aired multiple ads painting Mamdani as too young and too inexperienced.Mamdani, who has consistently polled as the runner-up to Cuomo and recently even overtook the ex-gov in one survey, is campaigning on a platform focused on affordability that includes promises to freeze rent for stabilized tenants, drastically expand subsidized child care and make public buses free, while paying for all of it by raising taxes on millionaires and corporations. That agenda would require complex legislative and regulatory reforms, actions some critics say Mamdani would be ill-equipped to carry out.Seeking to address concerns about his inexperience, Mamdani said he’d hire the “best and the brightest” in his mayoral administration and also noted his management of over 36,000 volunteers working for his campaign.Cuomo and Whitney Tilson, a former hedge fund manager running on a moderate Democratic platform, weren’t convinced and continued to paint Mamdani’s promises as unrealistic.“Mamdani math is fantasy,” Tilson said.Cuomo further questioned Mamdani’s experience by suggesting he doesn’t understand how rent stabilization laws work in New York City.“You should read,” Cuomo fumed after Mamdani questioned why he wouldn’t commit to as mayor freeze rent for stabilized tenants. Technically, a mayor can’t freeze the rent, as the Rent Guidelines Board sets those rates, but the mayor appoints all members to that panel.The tradition of mayoral debates is that candidates show up for a “spin room” question-and-answer gaggle with reporters afterward.Cuomo, who has employed a noticeably press shy strategy, was the only candidate who did not show up for the post-debate Q&A.“He won’t even come answer your questions,” Lander told reporters. “He is unfit to be mayor.”',

        'SEOUL: A North Korean naval destroyer damaged in a botched launch last month was successfully set afloat on a second attempt, with leader Kim Jong Un presiding, state media said on Friday (Jun 13). A ceremony for the ship baptised the Kang Kon - after a top North Korean general killed in the 1950-53 war - was held on Thursday at the Rajin shipyard, up the coast from where the botched attempt occurred, according to Pyongyang\'s official Korean Central News Agency. "Just over two weeks since the accident, the ship was safely raised and floated, and today, as planned, complete restoration has been finished," Kim said, according to KCNA. Kim has also approved a plan to build two more destroyer-class vessels next year, the agency added. The decision "heralds a significant and dramatic change in the status and defence activities of (our) Navy", Kim said, according to KCNA. Photos released by the agency showed Kim was accompanied by his daughter Ju Ae. He claimed that the "provocative intentions of the US and its allies" have recently become "more blatant, and the level of threats to our security has clearly gone far beyond the dangerous limit". "We must develop our naval power more comprehensively and rapidly so that the enemy cannot even think of carrying out aggressive actions in the waters around us," the North Korean leader said. The successful launch comes after Pyongyang last month announced "a serious accident" when workers first tried to put the 5,000-tonne destroyer into water in the northeastern port city of Chongjin. The mishap crushed sections of the bottom of the newly built ship. Pyongyang later covered it with a tarpaulin, satellite images showed. South Korean intelligence believe North Korea\'s so-called "side-launch attempt" of the ship failed, and the vessel was left listing in the water. Kim called the incident a "criminal act caused by absolute carelessness" and state media subsequently reported the arrest of four officials in connection with the botched launch. But the country said soon afterwards that the extent of damage to the vessel was "not serious", and that it would take "two or three days" to drain it, and another 10 to restore the destroyer\'s side. The South Korean military estimated that, based on its size and scale, the new warship is similarly equipped to the 5,000-tonne destroyer-class vessel Choe Hyon, which North Korea unveiled in late April. RUSSIAN HELP? Pyongyang has said the Choe Hyon is equipped with the "most powerful weapons", and that it would "enter into operation early next year." Some analysts said the ship could be equipped with short-range tactical missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads - although North Korea has not proven it has the ability to miniaturise its atomic arsenal. Seoul\'s military has said the Choe Hyon could have been developed with Russian help, possibly in exchange for Pyongyang deploying thousands of troops to help Moscow fight in Ukraine. North Korea confirmed in April for the first time that it had deployed troops to Russia to support Moscow in the Ukraine war. South Korea\'s new president, Lee Jae-myung , elected last week in a snap election, has promised a more dovish approach towards Pyongyang, compared with his hawkish impeached predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol. The Lee administration has halted loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts along the border , which Seoul began last year in response to a barrage of trash-filled balloons flown southward by Pyongyang. North Korea had resumed its own propaganda broadcasts last year, sending strange and eerie noises into the South, prompting complaints from border residents. On Thursday, Seoul\'s military said North Korea appears to have stopped broadcasting such noises along the border.',

        'Hello and welcome to another edition of The Crunch! There’s been so much great datavis published over the last couple of weeks, it was a real struggle to whittle down. But in this week’s newsletter we’ve got another great political▲triangle▲ chart , an analysis of the accuracy of Asian casting in Hollywood , a visual explainer on the Ukraine drone attack on Russia , an interactive map showing the extent of marine heatwaves and how you can mislead people by being selective with the data you show . But first ... what happened to the Greens? The Greens lost three seats and their party leader in the 2025 Australian federal election, despite a relatively steady national vote. How did this happen? We took a deep dive into the Greens vote , looking at how dispersed Greens voters are across the country, why a seat redistribution affected Adam Bandt in Melbourne, and the “three-cornered” contests between the Greens and the major parties in Brisbane. Stick around to the end of the piece to play with our interactive preferences calculator. Our colleagues in the US have also published this great visual guide to the Los Angeles protests. The map is particularly useful if, like us, you find it hard to tell the scale of the protests from the television coverage. Four charts from the fortnight *** 1. How accurately are Asian-Americans cast in Hollywood? There’s a lot to like in this visual essay from Dorothy Lu and Anna Li at the Pudding . It starts with a lovely comic strip explaining the inspiration for the piece, then takes a detailed look at Asian representation in cinema. *** 2. Ukraine drone attack Even days after Ukraine’s drone attack deep in Russian territory earlier in June, it was hard to imagine what exactly had happened. Reuters has a great visual explainer , showing what the drones look like and how they were smuggled into Russia inside modified trucks. *** 3. Marine heatwaves getting more frequent and widespread A quarter of the world’s oceans experienced temperatures in 2024 that qualify as a heatwave. Delger Erdenesanaa and climate graphics wizard Harry Stevens at the NYT have produced this interactive piece looking at how widespread marine heatwaves have become ($), with an excellent, if confronting, interactive map that shows the spread of heatwaves over time. The map also works really well on mobile, which you can’t always say about a lot of interactive maps. *** 4. ▲△▲MORE TRIANGLES ▲△▲ Regular readers of the Crunch will know that we love ternary scatterplots, so we were excited to see this view of Canadian election results which shows the movement of vote share in every federal riding (these are Canadian electoral districts), from third parties to the two major parties. The chart was made by designer Nick Abasolo, and you can read more about it here . Spotlight on kids education and health Off the Charts Page As The Economist’s Archie Hall said , this chart posted by the UK Conservatives is the type where when you start the x axis really matters: And so the FT’s Alphaville made this excellent edit of the chart , showing how inflation was far higher – and increased far more – under the Conservatives: Sign up Enjoying The Crunch?

        'President Donald Trump delivered a vicious screed against undocumented immigrations on Thursday, calling for their “remigration.” That terminology is popular in global far-right circles, and has been used by right-wing populist politicians in Europe to call for the mass deportations of immigrants in the name of restoring national identity. “The Biden Administration and Governor Newscum flooded America with 21 Million Illegal Aliens, destroying Schools, Hospitals and Communities, and consuming untold Billions of Dollars in Free Welfare,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, with whom he’s feuding at the moment. “All of them have to go home, as do countless other Illegals and Criminals, who will turn us into a bankrupt Third World Nation,” he continued. “America was invaded and occupied. I am reversing the Invasion. It’s called Remigration.” Trump praised ICE officers, who have sparked protests around the country with their raids and deportation efforts, as “HEROES.” “We will always have their back as they carry out this noble mission. America will be for Americans again!” Trump wrote. Trump has used the “remigration” term before. In September, he pledged to “immediately end the migrant invasion of America” if elected, and “return Kamala’s illegal migrants to their home countries (also known as remigration). At the time, liberal media watchdog Media Matters accused the press of largely failing to cover his use of the term and of failing to accurately contextualize the concept’s links to ethnic cleansing. The term was popularized in part by Martin Sellner, an Austrian far-right activist who was involved with neo-Nazis as a teenager. He has since distanced himself from that ideology, but prominently promotes extreme ethnonationalist ideas. He’s a leader of the Austrian chapter of Generation Identity, which anti-extremism groups have described as an international white supremacist network. In November 2023, Sellner reportedly presented a “master plan for remigration” at a meeting in Potsdam, Germany, which was attended by members of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, neo-Nazis, and other right-wing extremists. The co-leader of AfD, Alice Weidel, has since publicly embraced the term. Revelations about the meeting, reported by The Guardian and Correctiv in January, sparked uproar and mass protests in Germany. Sellner was subsequently banned from Germany. Trump’s State Department plans to create an entire “Office of Remigration” as part of a restructuring to aid Trump’s sweeping deportation plans.',
